\section*{About the Document}

	This document is a hybrid of many linear algebra resources, including those of
	the IOLA (Inquiry Oriented Linear Algebra) project, Jason Siefken's IBLLinearAlgebra
	project, and Asaki, Camfield, Moon, and Snipes' Radiograph and Tomography project.

	This document is a mix of student projects, problem sets, and labs.
	A typical class day looks like:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item {\bf Introduction by instructor.} This may involve giving a definition,
			a broader context for the day's topics, or answering questions.
		\item {\bf Students work on problems.} Students work individually or in pairs
			on the prescribed problem.  During this time the instructor moves around
			the room addressing questions that students may have and giving one-on-one
			coaching.
		\item {\bf Instructor intervention.} If most students have successfully solved the 
			problem, the instructor regroups the class by providing a concise 
			explanation so that everyone is ready to move to the next concept.  This
			is also time for the instructor to ensure that everyone has understood the
			main point of the exercise (since it is sometimes easy to do some computation
			while being oblivious to the larger context).

			If students are having trouble, the instructor can give hints to the group,
			and additional guidance to ensure the students don't get frustrated
			to the point of giving up.
		\item {\bf Repeat step 2.}
	\end{enumerate}

	Using this format, students are working (and happily so) most of the class.
	Further, they are especially primed to hear the insights of the instructor, 
	having already invested substantially into each problem.

	This problem-set is geared towards concepts instead of computation, though some problems
	focus on simple computation.

	\question
	\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex,scale=4]

		\draw[thick,blue] (2,1) circle [radius=.02] node [below right,black] {$q$};

	\end{tikzpicture}

	Notice that all arrows in this diagram are the same length.
	We will call this length a \emph{unit}.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Give directions from $\bf o$ to $p$ of
		the form ``Walk \ul units in the direction of arrow \ul, then 
		walk \ul units in the direction of arrow \ul.''

		\item Can you give directions with the two arrows you haven't
		used?  Give such directions, or explain why it cannot be done.

		\item Give directions from $\bf o$ to $q$.

		\item Can you give directions from $\bf o$ to $q$ using $\bf c$ and $\bf a$?
		Give such directions, or explain why it cannot be done.

	\end{parts}

	\question
	\begin{minipage}{.35\textwidth}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex,scale=4]
		\draw[style=help lines] (0,0) (1,2);

		\draw[->,thick,black] (0,0) -- (0,1) node [left] {$\yh$};
		\draw[->,thick,black] (0,0) -- (63.4:1) node [left] {$\mathbf c$};
		\draw[->,thick,black] (0,0) -- (1,0) node [above] {$\xh$};
		\draw (0,0) node [below] {$\mathbf o$};
		
		\draw[thick,blue,fill] (1,2) circle [radius=.02] node [below right,black] {$p$};

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{.65\textwidth}
	We are going to start using a more mathematical notation
	for giving directions.  Our directions will now look like
	\[
		p = \ull\, \xh + \ull\, \yh
	\]
	which is read as ``To get to $p$ (=) go \ul units in the direction $\xh$ then (+) go \ul units in 
	the direction $\yh$.''

	\begin{parts}
		\item What is the difference between $p = \ull\, \xh + \ull\, \yh$ and $p = \ull\, \yh + \ull\, \xh$?
		Can they both give valid directions?
		\item
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Give directions to $p$ using the new notation. 
			\item Give directions to $p$ using $\bf c$.  (Notice that
				$\bf c$ is of unit length and points directly at $p$.)
			\item What is the distance from $\bf o$ to $p$ in units?
		\end{enumerate}
		\item
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $r=1\bf c$.  Give directions from $\bf o$ to $r$ using $\xh$ and $\yh$.
			\item What is the distance from $\bf o$ to $r$?
		\end{enumerate}
		\item
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $q=-2\xh+3\yh$; find the exact distance from $\bf o$ to $q$.
			\item $s=2\xh+\bf c$; find the exact distance from $\bf o$ to $s$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{parts}
	\end{minipage}


	The vectors $\xh$ and $\yh$ are called the \emph{standard
	basis vectors} for $\R^2$ (the plane).  

\section*{Column Vector Notation}
	We previously wrote $q=-2\xh+3\yh$.  In column vector notation we write
	\[
		q=\begin{bmatrix}-2\\3\end{bmatrix}
	\]
	We may call $q$ either a \emph{vector} or a \emph{point}.  If we call $q$ a vector,
	we are emphasizing that $q$ gives direction of some sort.  If we call $q$ a point,
	we emphasize that $q$ is some absolute location in space. (What's the philosophical
	difference between a location in space and directions from the origin to said location?)

	\question 
	$r=1\bf c$ and $s=2\xh+\bf c$ where $\bf c$ is the vector from before.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Write $r$ and $s$ in column vector form.
	\end{parts}

\section*{Sets and Set Notation}

	\begin{definition}[Set]
		A \emph{set} is a (possibly infinite) collection of items
		and is notated with curly braces (for example, $\{1,2,3\}$ is
		the set containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3).  We call the items in
		a set \emph{elements}.

		If $X$ is a set and $a$ is an elemento of $X$, we may write $a\in X$,
		which is read ``$a$ is an element of $X$.''

		If $X$ is a set, a \emph{subset} $Y$ of $X$ (written $Y\subseteq X$)
		is a set such that every element of $Y$ is an element of $X$.

		We can define a subset using \emph{set-builder notation}.
		That is, if $X$ is a set, we can define the subset 
		\[
			Y= \{a\in X:\text{some rule involving }a\},
		\]
		which is read ``$Y$ is the set of $a$ in $X$ {\bf such that} some rule
		involving $a$ is true.''  If $X$ is intuitive, we may omit it and
		simply write $Y=\{a:\text{some rule involving }a\}$.  You may equivalently
		use ``$|$'' instead of ``$:$'', writing $Y=\{a\,|\,\text{some rule involving }a\}$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}
		Some common sets are
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] $\N=\{\text{natural numbers}\} = \{\text{non-negative whole numbers}\}$.
			\item[] $\Z=\{\text{integers}\} = \{\text{whole numbers, including negatives}\}$.
			\item[] $\R=\{\text{real numbers}\}$.
			\item[] $\R^n=\{\text{vectors in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space}\}$.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{definition}


	\question
	\begin{parts}
		\item Which of the following are true?
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $3\in\{1,2,3\}$.
			\item $1.5\in\{1,2,3\}$.
			\item $4\in\{1,2,3\}$.
			\item ``b''$\in\{x:x\text{ is an English letter}\}$.
			\item ``\`o''$\in\{x:x\text{ is an English letter}\}$.
			\item $\{1,2\}\subseteq \{1,2,3\}$.
			\item For some $a\in\{1,2,3\}$, $a \geq 3$.
			\item For any $a\in\{1,2,3\}$, $a\geq 3$.
			\item $1\subseteq\{1,2,3\}$.
			\item $\{1,2,3\}=\{x\in\R:1\leq x\leq 3\}$.
			\item $\{1,2,3\}=\{x\in\Z:1\leq x\leq 3\}$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{parts}

	\question
		Write the following in set-builder notation
	\begin{parts}
			\item The subset $A\subseteq \R$ of real numbers larger than $\sqrt{2}$.
			\item The subset $B\subseteq \R^2$ of vectors whose first coordinate
			is twice the second.
	\end{parts}

	\begin{definition}[Unions \& Intersections]
		Two common set operations are \emph{unions} and \emph{intersections}.  
		Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets.

		\hfill\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-3cm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[(union)] $X\cup Y = \{a:a\in X\text{ or }a\in Y\}$.
			\item[(intersection)] $X\cap Y = \{a: a\in X\text{ and }a\in Y\}$.
		\end{itemize}
		\end{minipage}
	\end{definition}

	\question
	Let $X=\{1,2,3\}$ and $Y=\{2,3,4,5\}$ and $Z=\{4,5,6\}$.  Compute
	\begin{parts}
		\item $X\cup Y$
		\item $X\cap Y$
		\item $X\cup Y\cup Z$
		\item $X\cap Y\cap Z$
	\end{parts}

	\question
	Draw the following subsets of $\R^2$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item $V=\left\{\vec x\in\R^2:\vec x=\begin{bmatrix}0\\t\end{bmatrix}\text{ for some }t\in\R\right\}$.
		\item $H=\left\{\vec x\in\R^2:\vec x=\begin{bmatrix}t\\0\end{bmatrix}\text{ for some }t\in\R\right\}$.
		\item $J=\left\{\vec x\in\R^2:\vec x=t\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}\text{ for some }t\in\R\right\}$.
		\item $V\cup H$.
		\item $V\cap H$.
		\item Does $V\cup H=\R^2$?
	\end{parts}



\section*{Systems of Linear Equations}
	
	\emph{Linear equations} are equations only involving variables, 
	multiplication by constants, and addition/subtraction.  \emph{Systems}
	of equations are sets of equations that share common variables.

	\question
	Consider the system
	\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
		\begin{array}{rcrl}
			x &-&y &= 2\\
			2x &+&y &= 1
		\end{array}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{parts}
		\item Draw the lines in (\ref{eq2}) on the same coordinate plane.
		\item Algebraically solve the system (\ref{eq2}).  What does this 
		solution represent on your graph?
	\end{parts}
	
	\question
	Let $L$ be the line given by $x-y=2$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Write an equation of a line that doesn't intersect $L$.
		\item Write an equation of a line that intersects $L$ in 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item one place.
			\item infinitely many places
			\item exactly two places
		\end{enumerate}
		or explain why no such equation exists.
		\item For each equation you came up with, solve the system algebraically.
		How can you tell algebraically how many solutions there are?
	\end{parts}

	\newpage
	\question
	Consider the augmented matrix
	\[
		A=\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
			1 & 2 & -1 & -7\\
			0 & 2 & 3 & 9\\
			0 & 0 & 1 & 1
		\end{array}\right].
	\]
	\begin{parts}
		\item Write the system of equations corresponding to $A$.
		\item Solve the system of equations corresponding to $A$.
	\end{parts}

\subsection*{The Row Reduction Algorithm}


	\question
	\begin{parts}
		\item Solve the system
		\begin{equation}\label{eq3}
			\begin{array}{rcrcrl}
				x&-&y&-&2z &= -5\\
				2x&+&3y&+&z &= 5\\
				0x&+&2y&+&3z &= 8
			\end{array}
		\end{equation}
		any way you like.

		\item Use an augmented matrix to solve the system (\ref{eq3}).
	\end{parts}

	The system (\ref{eq3}) can be interpreted in two ways (and switching between these 
	interpretations when appropriate is one of the most powerful tools of Linear 
	Algebra).  We can think of solutions to (\ref{eq3})
	as the intersection of three planes, or we can interpret the solution
	as coefficients of a linear combination.

	\begin{parts}[resume]
		\item Rewrite (\ref{eq3}) as a vector equation of the form
		\[
			x\vec v_1+y\vec v_2+z\vec v_3 = \vec p
		\]
		where $x,y,z$ are interpreted as scalar quantities.

		\item If $(x,y,z)$ is a solution to (\ref{eq3}), explain how to get from the
		origin to $\vec p$ using only $\vec v_1, \vec v_2, \vec v_3$.
		\item If $(x,y,z)$ is a solution to \eqref{eq3}, is $\vec p$ a linear combination of $\vec v_1$,
			$\vec v_2$, and $\vec v_3$?
	\end{parts}
	
	\begin{definition}[Vector Form of a Line]
		A line $\ell$ is written in \emph{vector form} if it is expressed
		as
		\[
			\vec x=\vec d t+\vec p
		\]
		for some vector $\vec x$ and point $\vec p$. That is, $\ell = \{\vec x: \vec x=
		\vec d t+\vec p\text{ for some } t\in\R \}$.
	\end{definition}

\subsection*{Infinite Solutions}
	\question
	Consider the system
	\begin{equation}\label{eq4}
		\begin{array}{rcrl}
			x&+&2y &= 3\\
			2x&+&4y &= 6
		\end{array}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{parts}
		\item How many solutions does (\ref{eq4}) have?
		\item Write the solutions to (\ref{eq4}) in vector form.
		\item What happens when you use an augmented matrix
		to solve (\ref{eq4})?
	\end{parts}


\newpage
\subsection*{Free Variables}
	\question
	Suppose the row-reduced augmented matrix corresponding to 
	a system is
	\[
		B=\left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
			1 & 2 & 3\\
			0 & 0 & 0
		\end{array}\right].
	\]
	After reducing, we have 1 equation and 2 unknowns, so we can make
	$2-1=1$ choices when writing a solution.  Let's make the
	choice $y=t$.
	
	\begin{parts}
		\item With the added equation $y=t$, solve the
		system represented by $B$.
	\end{parts}

	\question
	Consider the system given by the augmented matrix
	\[
		C=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc|c}
			1&0&1&2&0&-1\\
			0&1&1&0&0&3\\
			0&0&0&0&1&4
		\end{array}\right].
	\]
	and call the variables in this system $x_1,x_2,
	x_3,x_4,x_5$.

	\begin{parts}
		\item Write the system of equations represented by $C$.
		\item Identify how many choices you can make when writing
		down a solution corresponding to $C$.
		\item Add one equation (of the form $x_i=t$ or $x_j=s$, etc.)
		for each choice you must make when solving the system.
		\item Write in vector form all solutions to $C$.
	\end{parts}

	\question
	\begin{parts}
		\item An unknown system $U$ is represented by an augmented
		matrix with 4 rows, 6 columns, and one augmented column.  What is 
		the minimum number of
		free variables $U$ can have?
		\item An unknown system $V$ is represented by an augmented
		matrix with 6 rows, 4 columns, and one augmented column.  What is 
		the minimum number of
		free variables  $V$ can have?
	\end{parts}
	
	\question
	\begin{definition}[Homogeneous]
		A system is called \emph{homogeneous} if all equations equal $0$.
	\end{definition}

		Let $A$ be an unknown system of $3$ equations and $3$ variables and suppose
		 $(x,y,z)=(1,2,1)$ and
		$(x,y,z)=(-1,1,1)$ are solutions to $A$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Can you produce another solution
		to the system?

		\item  Can you
		produce a solution to the homogeneous version of $A$ (the version of $A$ where every
		equation equals 0)?

		\item Suppose when you use an augmented matrix to solve the system $A$, you only have 
		one free variable.  Could $A$ be homogeneous?  Can you produce all solutions to the system $A$?

\section*{Task 1.1: The Magic Carpet Ride}

You are a young traveler, leaving home for the first time. Your parents
want to help you on your journey, so just before your departure, they give
you two gifts. Specifically, they give you two forms of transportation:
a hover board and a magic carpet. Your parents inform you that both the
hover board and the magic carpet have restrictions in how they operate:


\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}

	\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1in}
	\vspace{-.8cm}
	\includegraphics[width=1in]{images/HoverBoard-small.png}
	\end{wrapfigure}

	We denote the restriction on the hover board's movement by the vector
	$\mat{3 \\1}$. By this we mean that if
	the hover board traveled ``forward'' for one hour, it would move along a
	``diagonal'' path that would result in a displacement of 3 miles East and
	1 mile North of its starting location.

	\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1in}
	\vspace{-.8cm}

	\end{wrapfigure}

	We denote the restriction on the magic carpet's movement by the vector
	$\mat{1 \\2 }$. By this we mean that if the
	magic carpet traveled ``forward'' for one hour, it would move along a
	``diagonal'' path that would result in a displacement of 1 mile East and
	2 miles North of its starting location.

\textbf{Scenario One: The Maiden Voyage}

Your Uncle Cramer suggests that your first adventure should be to go visit
the wise man, Old Man Gauss. Uncle Cramer tells you that Old Man Gauss
lives in a cabin that is 107 miles East and 64 miles North of your home.

\textbf{Task:}
\par
Investigate whether or not you can use the hover board and the magic
carpet to get to Gauss's cabin. If so, how? If it is not possible to
get to the cabin with these modes of transportation, why is that the case?

\textbf{Scenario Two: Hide-and-Seek}

Old Man Gauss wants to move to a cabin in a different location. You are

	\begin{definition}[Linear Combination]
		A \emph{linear combination} of the vectors $\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_n$ is
		a vector

		where $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n$ are scalars.

	\begin{definition}[Span]
		The \emph{span} of a set of vectors $V$ is the set of
		all linear combinations of vectors in $V$.  That is,
		\[
			\Span V = \{\vec v:\vec v=\alpha_1\vec v_1+\alpha_2\vec v_2 + \cdots 
			+\alpha_n\vec v_n\text{ for some }\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_n\in V
			\text{ and scalars }\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n\}.
		\]

	\question
	Let $\vec v_1=\mat{1\\1}$, $\vec v_2=\mat{1\\-1}$, and $\vec v_3=\mat{2\\2}$.

	In some sets, every vector is essential for computing a span.  In others,
	there are ``excess'' vectors.  This leads us to the concept of 
	linear independence.

	\begin{definition}[Linearly Dependent \& Independent]
		We say $\{\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_n\}$ is
		\emph{linearly dependent} if for at least one $i$,
		\[
			\vec v_i\in\span\{\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_{i-1},
			\vec v_{i+1},\ldots,\vec v_n\},
		\]
		and a set is \emph{linearly independent} otherwise.
	\end{definition}

	\question
		Let $\vec u=\mat{1\\0\\0}$, $\vec v=\mat{0\\1\\0}$, and $\vec w=\mat{1\\1\\0}$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Describe $\Span\{\vec u,\vec v,\vec w\}$.
		\item Is $\{\vec u,\vec v,\vec w\}$ linearly independent?  Why or why not?

\section*{Task 1.3: The Magic Carpet, Getting Back Home}

Suppose you are now in a three-dimensional world for the carpet
ride problem, and you have three modes of transportation:
\[
	\vec v_1 = \mat{1 \\1 \\ 1}\qquad
	\vec v_2 = \mat{6 \\3 \\ 8}\qquad
	\vec v_3 = \mat{4 \\1 \\ 6}
\]

You are only allowed to use each mode of transportation \textbf{once}
(in the forward or backward direction) for a fixed amount of time ($c_1$
on $\vec v_1$, $c_2$ on $\vec v_2$, $c_3$ on $\vec v_3$). Find the amounts of time on
each mode of transportation ($c_1$, $c_2$,  and $c_3$, respectively)
needed to go on a journey that starts and ends at home \emph{or} explain why
it is not possible to do so.

\vspace{10mm}

\newpage

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is there more than one way to make a journey that meets the
	requirements described above? (In other words, are there different
	combinations of times you can spend on the modes of transportation so
	that you can get back home?) If so, how?

	\vspace{65mm} 
	\item Is there anywhere in this 3D world that Gauss
	  could hide from you? If so, where? If not, why not?

	\vspace{65mm}
	\item What is $\Span \left\{\mat{1 \\1 \\  1},\mat{6 \\3 \\ 8},\mat{4  \\1 \\ 6} \right\}$?

	\begin{definition}[Trivial Linear Combination]
	We say a linear combination 
	$a_1\vec v_1+a_2\vec v_2+\cdots +a_n\vec v_n$
	is \emph{trivial} if $a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_n=0$.
	\end{definition}
	
	\question
		Recall $\vec u=\mat{1\\0\\0}$, $\vec v=\mat{0\\1\\0}$, and $\vec w=\mat{1\\1\\0}$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Consider the linearly dependent 
		set $\{\vec u,\vec v,\vec w\}$ (where $\vec u,\vec v,\vec w$
		are defined as above).  Can you write $\vec 0$
		as a non-trivial linear combination of vectors in this set?
		\item Consider the linearly independent 
		set $\{\vec u,\vec v\}$.  Can you write $\vec 0$
		as a non-trivial linear combination of vectors in this set?
	\end{parts}

	We now have an equivalent definition of linear dependence.

	\begin{definition}[Linearly Dependent \& Independent]
	$\{\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_n\}$ is
	\emph{linearly dependent} if there is a non-trivial
	linear combination of $\vec v_1,\ldots,\vec v_n$ that
	equals the zero vector.
	\end{definition}

	\question
	\begin{parts}
		\item Explain how this new definition implies the old one.
		\item Explain how the old definition implies this new one.
	\end{parts}

	Since we have old def $\implies$ new def, and new def $\implies$ old def ($\implies$
	should be read aloud as `implies'), the two definitions
	are \emph{equivalent} (which we write as new def $\iff$ old def).


	\question
	Suppose for some unknown $\vec u, \vec v, \vec w$, and $\vec a$,
	\[
		\vec a = 3\vec u+2\vec v +\vec w\qquad \text{and}\qquad 
		\vec a = 2\vec u+\vec v -\vec w.
	\]
	\begin{parts}
		\item Could the set $\{\vec u,\vec v,\vec w\}$ be linearly
		independent?
	\end{parts}
	Suppose that
	\[
		\vec a = \vec u+6\vec r-\vec s
	\]
	is the \emph{only} way to write $\vec a$ using $\vec u,\vec r,\vec s$.
	\begin{parts}[resume]
		\item Is $\{\vec u,\vec r,\vec s\}$ linearly independent?
		\item Is $\{\vec u,\vec r\}$ linearly independent?
		\item Is $\{\vec u,\vec v,\vec w,\vec r\}$ linearly independent?
	\end{parts}

\section*{Subspaces and Bases}
	\vspace{-1em}
	\begin{definition}[Subspace]
		A \emph{subspace} $V\subseteq \R^n$ is a non-empty subset such that
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[(i)] $\vec u,\vec v\in V$ implies $\vec u+\vec v\in V$.
			\item[(ii)] $\vec u\in V$ implies $k\vec u\in V$ for all scalars $k$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{definition}

	Subspaces give a mathematically precise definition of a ``flat space through the origin.''

	\question
	For each set, draw it and explain whether or not it is a subspace of $\R^2$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item $A=\{\vec x\in\R^2:\vec x=\mat{a\\0}\text{ for some }a\in\Z\}$.

		\item $D=\{\vec x\in\R^2:\vec x=\mat{0\\t}+\mat{1\\1}\text{ for some }t\in\R\}$.
		\item $E=\{\vec x\in\R^2:\vec x=\mat{0\\t}\text{ or }\vec x=\mat{t\\0}\text{ for some }t\in\R\}$.
		\item $F=\{\vec x\in\R^2:\vec x=t\mat{3\\1}\text{ for some }t\in\R\}$.
		\item $G=\span\left\{\mat{1\\1}\right\}$.
		\item $H=\span\{\vec u,\vec v\}$ for some unknown vectors $\vec u,\vec v\in\R^2$.
	\end{parts}

	\begin{definition}[Basis]
		A \emph{basis} for a subspace $V$ is a linearly independent set of vectors, $\mathcal B$,
		so that $\Span\mathcal B=V$.
	\end{definition}

	\question
	Let $\vec u=\mat{1\\0\\0}$, $\vec v=\mat{0\\1\\0}$, $\vec w=\mat{1\\1\\0}$, and $V=\span\{\vec u,\vec v,\vec w\}$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Describe $V$.
		\item Is $\{\vec u,\vec v,\vec w\}$ a basis for $V$?  Why or why not?
		\item Give a basis for $V$.
		\item Give another basis for $V$.
		\item Is $\Span\{\vec u,\vec v\}$ a basis for $V$?  Why or why not?
	\end{parts}

	\begin{definition}[Dimension]
		The \emph{dimension} of a subspace $V$ is the number of elements in a basis for $V$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{parts}[resume]
		\item What is the dimension of $V$?
	\end{parts}


	\question
	Let $\vec a=\mat{1\\2\\3}$, $\vec b=\mat{4\\5\\6}$, $\vec c=\mat{7\\8\\8}$ and 
	let $P=\span\{\vec a,\vec b\}$ and $Q=\span\{\vec b,\vec c\}$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Give a basis for and the dimension of $P$.
		\item Give a basis for and the dimension of $Q$.
		\item Is $P\cap Q$ a subspace? If so, give a basis for it and its dimension.

Two students---Pat and Jamie---explained their approach to the Italicizing N task as follows:
\begin{quote}\itshape
	In order to find the matrix $A$, we are going to find a matrix that makes the ``N'' taller,
	find a matrix that italicizes the taller ``N,'' and a combination of those two matrices
	will give the desired matrix $A$.
\end{quote}

Consider the new task: find a matrix $C$ that transforms the ``N'' on the right to
the ``N'' on the left.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use any method you like to find $C$.
		\vspace{\stretch{1}}
	\item Use a method similar to Pat and Jamie's method, only use it to find $C$ instead
		of $A$.

	\begin{definition}[Eigenvector]
	For a linear transformation $X$, an \emph{eigenvector} for $X$ is a non-zero vector that doesn't

	\[
		X\vec v=\lambda \vec v

\section*{Orthogonality}
	\begin{definition}[Orthogonal \& Orthonormal]

		if it is both an orthogonal set and every vector is a unit vector.
	\end{definition}

	Matrix equations involving orthogonal matrices are easy to solve because the
	inverse of an orthogonal matrix is so easy to compute!
	
	\question

	\begin{parts}

				     \vec a_2\cdot \vec b\\
			     	     \vec a_3\cdot \vec b\\
			     	     \vec a_4\cdot \vec b}$ is a solution to $A\vec x=\vec b$.
		\item Find scalars $a,b,c,d$ so $\vec b=a\vec a_1+b\vec a_2+c\vec a_3+d\vec a_4$
			(your answers will have variables in them).
	\end{parts}

	Orthogonal matrices also allow us to compute projections quite easily.

	\begin{definition}[Orthogonal Projection]
		If $V$ is a subspace of $\R^n$, the \emph{projection}
		(sometimes called the orthogonal projection) of $\vec x$ onto $V$
		is the closest point in $V$ to $\vec x$. We notate the projection
		of $\vec x$ onto $V$ as $\proj_V\vec x$.
	\end{definition}

	Projections are normally hard to compute and a priori might require some sort
	of calculus-style optimization to find.  However, from geometry we know that 
	if we travel from $\proj_V \vec x$ to $\vec x$, we should always trace out a path
	perpendicular to $V$.  Otherwise, we could find a point in $V$ that was slightly closer
	to $\vec x$, violating the definition of $\proj_V \vec x$.  Thus, orthogonality
	will be our savior.

\subsection*{Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization}
	We've seen how useful orthonormal bases are.  The incredible thing is that we can 
	turn any basis into an orthonormal basis through a process called
	Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.

	\question
	Let $\vec a=\mat{1\\2}$ and $\vec b=\mat{3\\1}$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Draw $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ and find $\vec w=\proj_{\vec b}\vec a$.
		\item Add $\vec c=\vec a-\vec w$ to your drawing.  What is the angle between
			$\vec c$ and $\vec b$.
		\item Can you write $\vec a$ as the sum of two vectors, one in 
			the direction of $\vec b$ and one orthogonal to $\vec b$?
			If so, do it.
	\end{parts}

	\question
	Let $\vec a=\mat{1\\2\\6}$ and $\vec b=\mat{1\\1\\-1}$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Write $\vec a=\vec u+\vec v$ where $\vec u$ is parallel to
			$\vec b$ and $\vec v$ is orthogonal to $\vec b$.
		\item Find an orthonormal basis for $\span\{\vec a,\vec b\}$.
	\end{parts}

	With two vectors, making an orthonormal set without changing the span
	is quite easy.  With more vectors, it is only slightly harder.

	\begin{definition}[Gram-Schmidt Process]
		The \emph{Gram-Schmidt} orthogonalization procedure
		takes in a set of vectors and outputs a set of orthonormal vectors
		with the same span.  The idea is to iteratively produce a set of
		vectors where each new vector you produce is orthogonal to the previous vectors.

		The algorithm is as follows: Let $\{ v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$ be a set of 
		vectors.  Produce a set $\{ v_2',\ldots, v_n'\}$ that is orthogonal
		to $ v_1$ by subtracting off the respective projections
		of $ v_2,\ldots, v_n$
		onto $ v_1$.  Next, produce a set $\{ v_3'',\ldots, v_n''\}$
		orthogonal to both $ v_1$ and $ v_2'$ by subtracting off the
		respective projections
		onto $ v_2'$.  Continue this process until you have a set
		$V=\{ v_1, v_2', v_3'', v_4''',\ldots\}$ that is orthogonal.
		Finally, normalize $V$ so all vectors have unit length.
	\end{definition}

		\item Find an orthonormal basis $\mathcal W$ so that $\span\mathcal W=

	\begin{definition}[Orthogonal Complement]
		The \emph{orthogonal complement} of a subspace $V$ is written
		$V^\perp$ and defined as
		\[
			V^\perp=\{\vec x:\vec x\text{ is orthogonal to }V\}.
		\]

\subsection*{$QR$ Decomposition}

	\begin{definition}[$QR$ Decomposition]
		For a matrix $A$, we can rewrite $A=QR$ where $Q$ is an
		orthogonal matrix and $R$ is an upper triangular matrix.  Writing
		$A$ as $QR$ is called the \emph{$QR$ decomposition} of $A$.
	\end{definition}

	\question
	Suppose $A,B,C$ are square matrices and $C=AB$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item How do the column spaces of $A$ and $C$ relate?
		\item How do the column spaces of $B$ and $C$ relate?
	\end{parts}

	\question
	$\mathcal V=\{\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\vec v_3\}$ forms a basis for $\R^3$.
	When we apply the Gram-Schmidt process to $\mathcal V$, we get
	\[
		\begin{array}{rl}
			q_1' &=\vec v\\
			q_2' &= \vec v_2-\frac{1}{2}\vec v_2\\
			q_3' &= \vec v_3-\vec v_1+2\vec v_2
		\end{array}
	\]
	form an orthogonal set.  Normalizing we get
	\[
		\begin{array}{rl}
			\vec q_1 &= 2q_1'\\
			\vec q_2 &= 3q_2'\\
			\vec q_3 &=\frac{1}{2}q_3'
		\end{array}
	\]
	form an orthonormal set.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Write $\vec v_1$ as a linear combination of $\vec q_1,\vec q_2,\vec q_3$.
		\item Write $\vec v_2$ as a linear combination of $\vec q_1,\vec q_2,\vec q_3$.
		\item Write $\vec v_3$ as a linear combination of $\vec q_1,\vec q_2,\vec q_3$.
	\end{parts}
	Define $A=[\vec v_1|\vec v_2|\vec v_2]$ and $Q=[\vec q_1|\vec q_2|\vec q_3]$.
	\begin{parts}[resume]
		\item Find a matrix $R$ so that $A=QR$.
	\end{parts}
	
	We've just discovered one process to find the $QR$ decomposition of a matrix.
	It's really as simple as doing Gram-Schmidt and keeping track of your coefficients.
	Now, we have another way to the matrix equation $A\vec x=\vec b$.  If we do a $QR$
	decomposition and exploit the fact that $Q^{-1}=Q^T$, we have
	\[
		A\vec x=QR\vec x=\vec b\qquad\implies\qquad R\vec x=Q^T\vec b
	\]
	and $R$ is a triangular matrix, so we can just do back substitution! (It turns
	out that if you solve systems this way, there is less rounding error than if you
	use row reduction.)

\subsection*{Symmetric Matrices}
	When you're new to Linear Algebra, learning lots of new concepts and algorithms,
	it's sometimes hard to grasp the significance of certain properties of a matrix.

	Symmetric matrices are easy to forget at first, but they have many profound 
	properties (not to mention they are one of the key concepts of Quantum Mechanics).

	\question
	Let $A$ be a symmetric matrix and let $\vec v$ be an eigenvector with eigenvalue
	3 and $\vec w$ be an eigenvector with eigenvalue 4.  Note, for this problem,
	we are thinking of $\vec v$ and $\vec w$ as column vectors.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Write $A\vec v$, $\vec v^TA^T$, $\vec v^TA$, $A\vec w$, $\vec w^TA^T$, 
		and $\vec w^TA$ in terms of $\vec v$, $\vec w$ and scalars.
		\item How do $\vec v^T\vec w$ and $\vec w^T\vec v$ relate?
		\item What should $\vec v^TA\vec w$ be in terms of $\vec v^T$ and
			$\vec w$? (Note, you could compute $(\vec v^TA)\vec w$
			or $\vec v^T(A\vec w)$.  Better do both to be safe).
		\item What can you conclude about $\vec v^T\vec w$?  How about
			$\vec v\cdot \vec w$?
	\end{parts}

	We've just deduced that all eigenspaces of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal! On
	top of that, symmetric matrices always have a basis of eigenvectors.  That means
	that not only can you always diagonalize a symmetric matrix, but you can 
	\emph{orthogonally} diagonalize a symmetric matrix. (i.e. if $A$ is symmetric,
	then $A=QDQ^T$ where $Q$ is orthogonal and $D$ is diagonal).  This is like the 
	best of all worlds in one!
