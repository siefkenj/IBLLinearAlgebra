		\begin{objectives}
	In this tutorial you will be working with transformations and practicing your
			mathematical writing.

	These problems relate to the following course learning objectives:
			\textit{Clearly and correctly express the mathematical ideas of linear algebra to others,
			and understand and apply logical arguments and definitions that have been written by others}.
		\end{objectives}


\subsection*{Problems}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Write the definition of what it means for the function $T:\R^n\to\R^m$ to be \emph{linear}.

	\item Each of the following functions (transformations) have $\R^2$ as their domain.
		For each one, first, decide whether or not
		it is linear, and then write out a proof of your claim.
		\[
			\mathcal A\left(\mat{x\\y}\right) = \mat{y\\0\\x},\qquad
			\mathcal B\left(\mat{x\\y}\right) = \begin{cases}
								x &\text{ if } x>0\\
								0 &\text{ else}
								\end{cases},\qquad
			\mathcal C\left(\vec x\right) = \vec 0,\qquad
			\mathcal D\left(\mat{x\\y}\right) = \mat{1\\1}
		\]
	\item For each linear transformation from the previous part, compute its rank.
	\item For each linear transformation from the previous part, find its null space and range.
	\item For each of the following, write down an example of a linear transformation with the
		given properties, or explain why it is impossible.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $\mathcal X:\R^2\to\R^2$ with rank $2$.
			\item $\mathcal Y:\R^2\to\R^2$ with rank $3$.
			\item $\mathcal Z:\R^2\to\R^3$ with rank $1$.
			\item $\mathcal W:\R\to\R$.
			\item $\mathcal Q:\R^{17}\to\R$ so that $\mathcal Q(\vec 0)=4$.
