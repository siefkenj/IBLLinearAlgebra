Lines or planes through the origin can be written as spans
of their direction vectors. However, a line or plane that doesn't
pass through the origin cannot be written as a span---it must
be expressed as a \emph{translated} span.

There's something special about sets that can be expressed as 
(untranslated) spans. In particular, since a linear combination
of linear combinations is still a linear combination, a span
is \emph{closed} with respect to linear combinations. That is, 
by taking linear combinations of vectors in a span, you cannot
escape the span. In general, sets that have this property are called
\emph{subspaces}\index{subspace}.

\SavedDefinitionRender{Subspace}

In the definition of subspace, property (i) is called
	begin \emph{closed with respect to vector addition} and
	property (ii) is called being \emph{closed with respect to
	scalar multiplication}.

Subspaces generalize the idea of \emph{flat spaces through the origin}. They encompass
lines, planes, volumes and more.

\begin{example}
	Let $\mathcal V\subseteq \R^2$ be the complete solution to 
	$x+2y=0$.  Show that $\mathcal V$ is a subspace.

\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Let $\mathcal W\subseteq \R^2$ be the line expressed in vector form
	as 
	\[
		\vec x=t\mat{1\\2}+\mat{1\\1}.
	\]
	Determine whether $\mathcal W$ is a subspace.

	XXX Finish
\end{example}


As mentioned earlier, subspaces and spans are deeply connected
by the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
	Every subspace is a span and every span is a subspace.  More precisely,
	$\mathcal V\subseteq \R^n$ is a subspace if and only if $\mathcal V=
	\Span\mathcal X$ for some set $\mathcal X$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We will start by showing every span is a subspace.  Fix $\mathcal X\subseteq\R^2$
	and let
	$\mathcal V=\Span\mathcal X$. First note that if $\mathcal X\neq \Set{}$, then $\mathcal V$
	is non-empty because $\mathcal X\subseteq\mathcal V$ and if $\mathcal X=\Set{}$, then $\mathcal V=\Set{\vec 0}$,
	and so is still non-empty.
	
	Fix $\vec v,\vec u\in\mathcal V$. By definition there are $\vec x_1,\vec x_2,\ldots,\vec y_1,\vec y_2,\ldots\in\mathcal X$ 
	and scalars $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots$ so that
	\[
		\vec v=\sum \alpha_i\vec x_i\qquad \vec u=\sum\beta_i\vec y_i.
	\]

	To verify property (i), observe that
	\[
		\vec u+\vec v=\sum\alpha_i\vec x_i + \sum\beta_i\vec y_i
	\]
	is also a linear combination of vectors in $\mathcal X$ (because all $\vec x_i$ and $\vec y_i$
	are in $\mathcal X$), and so $\vec u+\vec v\in	\Span\mathcal X=\mathcal V$.
	
	To verify property (ii), observe that for any scalar $\alpha$, 
	\[
		\alpha\vec v=\alpha\sum \alpha_i\vec x_i = \sum (\alpha\alpha_i)\vec x_i\in
		\Span\mathcal X=\mathcal V.
	\]
	Since $\mathcal V$ is non-empty and satisfies both properties (i) and (ii), it is a subspace.

	Now we will prove that every subspace is a span. Let $\mathcal V$ be a subspace
	and consider $\mathcal V'=\Span\mathcal V$.  Since taking a span may only enlarge a set, we know
	$\mathcal V\subseteq \mathcal V'$. If we establish that $\mathcal V'\subseteq\mathcal V$,
	then $\mathcal V=\mathcal V'=\Span\mathcal V$, which would complete the proof.

	Fix $\vec x\in\mathcal V'$. By definition, there are $\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_n\in\mathcal V$ and scalars
	$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n$ so that
	\[
		\vec x=\sum \alpha_i\vec v_i.
	\]
	Observe that 
	$\alpha_i\vec v_i\in\mathcal V$ for all $i$, since $\mathcal V$ is closed under scalar
	multiplication. It follows that $\alpha_1\vec v_1+\alpha_2\vec v_2\in\mathcal V$
	because $\mathcal V$ is closed under sums. Continuing, 
	$(\alpha_1\vec v_1+\alpha_2\vec v_2)+\alpha_3\vec v_3\in\mathcal V$ because
	$\mathcal V$ is closed under sums. By finite induction we see
	\[
		\vec x=\sum \alpha_i\vec v_i
		=\Big(\big((\alpha_1\vec v_1+\alpha_2\vec v_2)
		+\alpha_3\vec v_3\big)+\cdots+\alpha_{n-1}\vec v_{n-1} \Big)
		+\alpha_n\vec v_n\in\mathcal V.
	\]
	Thus $\mathcal V'\subseteq\mathcal V$, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

The previous theorem is saying that spans and subspaces are two ways of talking about the same
thing. Spans provide a \emph{constructive} definition of lines/planes/volumes/etc. through the origin. That is,
when you describe a line/plane/etc. through the origin as a span, you're saying ``this is a line/plane/etc. through the origin
because every point in it is a linear combination of \emph{these specific vectors}''. In contrast, subspaces provide a \emph{categorical}
definition of lines/planes/etc. through the origin. 
When you describe a line/plane/etc. through the origin as a subspace, 
you're saying ``this is a line/plane/etc. through the origin because these \emph{properties} are satisfied'' even though
you might not be able to specify any of the vectors inside.


\begin{emphbox}[Takeaway]
	Spans and subspaces are two different ways of talking about the same objects: points/lines/planes/etc. through the origin.
\end{emphbox}

\Heading{Special Subspaces}
When thinking about $\R^n$ there are two special subspaces that are always available. The first is $\R^n$ itself.
$\R^n$ is obviously non-empty, and linear combinations of vectors in $\R^n$ remain in $\R^n$. The second is
the \emph{trivial subspace}, $\Set{\vec 0}$.

\SavedDefinitionRender{TrivialSubspace}

\begin{theorem}
	The trivial subspace is a subspace.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	First note that $\Set{\vec 0}$ is non-empty since $\vec 0\in\Set{\vec 0}$. Now, since
	$\vec 0$ is the only vector in $\Set{\vec 0}$, properties (i) and (ii) follow quickly:
	\[
		\vec 0+\vec 0=\vec 0\in \Set{\vec 0}
	\]
	and
	\[
		\alpha\vec 0=\vec 0\in\Set{\vec 0}.
	\]
\end{proof}

\Heading{Bases}

Let $\vec d=\mat{1\\2}$ and consider $\ell=\Span\Set{\vec d}$.

XXX Figure

We know that $\ell$ is a subspace and, for instance, $\ell=\Span\Set{\vec d,-2\vec d,\tfrac{1}{2}\vec d}$. However,
the simplest descriptions of $\ell$ involve the span of only one vector.


Analogously, let $\mathcal P=\Span\Set{\vec d_1,\vec d_2}$ be the plane
through the origin with direction vectors $\vec d_1$ and $\vec d_2$. There
are many ways to write $\mathcal P$ as a span, but the simplest ones
involve exactly two vectors. The idea of a \emph{basis} comes
from trying to find the simplest description of a subspace.

\SavedDefinitionRender{Basis}

In short, a basis for a subspace is a linearly independent set that spans that
subspace.

\begin{example}
	\label{EXLINEBASIS}
	Let $\ell=\Span\Set*{\mat{1\\2},\mat{-2\\-4}, \mat{1/2\\1}}$. Find
	two different bases for $\ell$.

    We can see that $\mat{1\\2}$ and $\mat{-2\\-4}$ are linearly {\it{dependent}} because $-2\mat{1\\2} = \mat{-2\\-4}$. However, $\mat{1/2\\1}$ is linearly dependent of $\mat{1\\2}$ and $\mat{-2\\-4}$ as well! And since a basis cannot be formed by a set of linearly dependent vectors, a basis for $\ell$ that contains one of these vectors certainly cannot contain any of the other two. We can use this information to form our two bases; let's call them $\mathcal B_1$ and $\mathcal B_2$.
    \[
		\mathcal B_1 = \Set*{\mat{1\\2}}\qquad
		\mathcal B_2 = \Set*{\mat{1/2\\1}}\qquad
	\]
	
    % Might need some more explanation on how the span of B1 is equal to \ell and the span of B2 is equal to \ell.
    % I was considering writing down \Span\Set*{\mat{1\\2}} = \Span\Set*{\mat{-2\\-4}} = \Span\Set*{\mat{1/2\\1}} and making B_2 = \Set*{\mat{-6\\-12}} to show that a) the element(s) of a basis does not have to be the same vectors *explicitly* written down in the question, since the subspace is formed by the span of those vectors anyways and b) once you find the smallest set of vectors which span the subspace, you've already done all the work to find a basis; there's hardly anything left after that.
	XXX Finish
\end{example}

Unpacking the definition of basis a little more, we can see that for a 
subspace $\mathcal V$, a basis for $\mathcal V$ is a set of vectors
that is \emph{just the right size} to describe everything in $\mathcal V$.
It's not too big---because it is linearly independent, there are no
redundancies. It's not too small---because we require it to span $\mathcal V$\footnote{ 
If you're into British fairy tales, you might call a basis a \emph{Goldilocks set}.
}.

There are several facts everyone should know about bases:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Bases are not unique. Every subspace (except the trivial subspace)
		has multiple bases.
	\item Given a basis for a subspace, every vector in the subspace can be written
		as a \emph{unique} linear combination of vectors in that subspace.
	\item Any two bases for the same subspace have the same number of elements.
\end{enumerate}

You can prove the first fact by observing that if $\mathcal B=\Set{\vec b_1,\vec b_2,\ldots}$ is a basis
with at least one element\footnote{ The empty set is a basis for the trivial subspace.}, then
$\Set{2\vec b_1,2\vec b_2,\ldots}$ is a different basis. The second fact is a consequence of all bases 
being linearly independent. The third fact is less obvious and takes some legwork to prove, so we will accept it
as is.

\Heading{Dimension}

Let $\mathcal V$ be a subspace. Though there are many bases for $\mathcal V$, they all
have the same number of vectors in them. And, this number says something fundamental about $\mathcal V$:
it tells us the maximum number of linearly independent vectors that can simultaneously exist in $\mathcal V$.
We call this number the \emph{dimension} of $\mathcal V$.

\SavedDefinitionRender{Dimension}

This definition agrees with our intuition about lines and planes: the dimension of a line through $\vec 0$ is $1$, and
the dimension of a plane through $\vec 0$ is $2$. It even tells us the dimension of the single point $\Set{\vec 0}$
is $0$\footnote{ The dimension of a line, plane, or point
not through the origin is defined to be the dimension of the subspace obtained
when translating it to the origin.}.

\begin{example}
	Find the dimension of $\R^2$.

	Since $\Set{\xhat, \yhat}$ is a basis for $\R^2$, we know $\R^2$ is
	two dimensional.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Let $\ell=\Span\Set*{\mat{1\\2},\mat{-2\\-4}, \mat{1/2\\1}}$. Find the dimension of subspace $\ell$.
	
	Most of the work here comes from finding a basis for $\ell$, which we've already done earlier. After that, finding the dimension of $\ell$ is as easy as counting the number of elements in that basis. Since $\mathcal B_1 = \Set*{\mat{1\\2}}$ contains one element, $\ell$ is one dimensional\footnote{We could have looked at $\mathcal B_2$ or any of the other infinitely many possible bases for $\ell$ and the result would have been the same since each of those bases contains only one element.}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Let $A=\Set{(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\given x_1+2x_2-x_3=0\text{ and }x_1+6x_4=0}$. Find a basis for and the dimension
	of $A$.

	XXX Finish
\end{example}

Like $\R^2$ and $\R^3$, whenever we discuss $\R^n$, we always have a standard basis that comes
along for the ride.

\SavedDefinitionRender{StandardBasisforRn}

The notation $\vec e_i$ is context specific. If we say $\vec e_i\in\R^2$,
then $\vec e_i$ must have exactly two components. If we say $\vec e_i\in\R^{45}$,
then $\vec e_i$ must have $45$ components.
