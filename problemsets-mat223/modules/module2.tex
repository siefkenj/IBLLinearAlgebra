With a handle on vectors, we can now use them to describe some common geometric
objects: lines and planes.

\Heading{Lines}
Consider for a moment the line $\ell$ through the points $P$ and $Q$.  When $P,Q\in\R^2$, we
can describe $\ell$ with an equation of the form $y=mx+b$ (provided it isn't a vertical line), but if
$P,Q\in\R^3$, it's much harder to describe $\ell$ with an equation.  Using vectors
provides an easier way.

Let $\vec d=\overrightarrow{PQ}$ and consider the set of points (or vectors) $\vec x$ that can be expressed as
\[
	\vec x=t\vec d+P
\]
for $t\in \R$.  Geometrically, this is the set of all points we get by starting at $P$ and
displacing by some multiple of $\vec d$.  This is a line!

We simultaneously interpret this line as a set of points (the points that make up
the line) and as a set of vectors 
rooted at the origin (the vectors pointing from the origin to the line).
Note that sometimes we draw vectors as directed line segments.
Other times, drawing drawing vectors as line segments makes
it hard to see what is going on, and so it is better to draw
each vector by marking only its ending point.

\begin{emphbox}[Takeaway]
	When drawing a picture depicting several vectors, make an appropriate choice (arrows, dots, or
	a mix) so that the picture is clear.
\end{emphbox}

The line $\ell$ described above can be written in set-builder notation
as:
\[
	\ell=\Set{\vec x\given \vec x=t\vec d+P\text{ for some }t\in \R}.
\]
Notice that in set-builder notation, we write ``for some $t\in \R$.'' Make sure you
understand why replacing ``for some $t\in\R$'' with ``for
all $t\in \R$'' would be incorrect.

Writing lines with set-builder notation all the time can be overkill,
so we will allow ourselves to describe lines in a shorthand called \emph{vector form}\footnote{
	$y=mx+b$ form of a line is also shorthand.  The line $\ell$ described by the equation
	$y=mx+b$ is actually the set $\Set{(x,y)\in\R^2\given y=mx+b}$.
}.

\SavedDefinitionRender{VectorFormofaLine}

We can also use coordinates when writing a line in vector form. For example,
\[
	\mat{x\\y}=t\mat{d_1\\d_2}+\mat{p_1\\p_2}
\]
corresponds to the line passing through $\mat{p_1\\p_2}$ with $\mat{d_1\\d_2}$ as a direction vector.

The ``$t$'' that appears in a vector form is called the \emph{parameter variable}, and for this
reason, some textbooks use the term \emph{parametric form} in place of ``vector form''. 

Writing a line in vector form only requires a point on the line and a direction for the line.
Thus, converting to vector form from another form is straightforward.
\begin{example}
	Find vector form of the line $\ell\subseteq\R^2$ with equation $y=2x+3$.

	First, we find two
	points on the line.  By guess-and-check we see $P=(0,3)$ and $Q=(1,5)$ are on $\ell$.
	Thus, a direction vector for $\ell$ is given by
	\[
		\vec d = (1,5)-(0,3)=(1,2).
	\]
	We may now express $\ell$ in vector form as
	\[
		\vec x=t\vec d+P
	\]
	or, in components,
	\[
		\mat{x\\y} = t\mat{1\\2}+\mat{0\\3}.
	\]
\end{example}

It's important to note that when we write a line in vector form, it is a \emph{specific shorthand} notation.
If we augment the notation, we no longer have written a line in ``vector form''.

\begin{example} Let $\ell$ and let $\vec d$ be a direction vector for $\ell$ and let $\vec p\in \ell$
	be a point on $\ell$. Writing
	\[
		\vec x=t\vec d+\vec p
	\]
	or 
	\[
		\vec x=t\vec d+\vec p\quad\text{ where }\quad t\in \R
	\]
	specifies $\ell$ in vector form and are both shorthands for $\Set{\vec x\given
	\vec x=t\vec d+\vec p\text{ for some }t\in \R}$. But,
	\[
		\vec x=t\vec d+\vec p\quad\text{ for some }\quad t\in \R
	\]
	and
	\[
		\vec x=t\vec d+\vec p\quad\text{ for all }\quad t\in \R
	\]
	are logical statements about the vectors $\vec x$, $\vec d$, and
	$\vec p$. These statements are either true or false; they do \emph{not} 
	specify $\ell$ in vector form.

	Similarly, the statement
	\[
		\ell = t\vec d+\vec p
	\]
	is mathematically nonsensical and does not specify $\ell$ in vector form. (On the
	left is a \emph{set} and on the right is a \emph{vector}!)

\end{example}

But, why is vector form useful? For starters, every line can be expressed in vector form 
(you cannot write a vertical line in $y=mx+b$ form, and in $\R^3$, you would need two linear equations
to represent a line). But, the most useful thing about expressing a line in vector form is that
you can easily generate points on that line.

Suppose $\ell$ can be represented in vector form as $\vec x=t\vec d+\vec p$.
Then, for every $t\in \R$, the vector $t\vec d +\vec p\in\ell$. Not only that, but as $t$ ranges over
$\R$, all points on $\ell$ are ``traced out''. Thus, we can find points on $\ell$ without having to ``solve''
any equations.

The downside to using vector form is that it is not unique. There are multiple direction vectors and multiple points
for every line.  Thus, merely by looking at the vector equation for two lines, it can be hard to tell if
they're equal.

For example,
\[
	\mat{x\\y} = t\mat{1\\2}+\mat{0\\3},\qquad
	\mat{x\\y} = t\mat{2\\4}+\mat{0\\3},\quad\text{and}\quad
	\mat{x\\y} = t\mat{1\\2}+\mat{1\\5}
\]
all represent the same line.  In the second equation, the direction vector is parallel but scaled, and in
the third equation, a different point on the line was chosen.

Recall that in vector form, the variable $t$ is called the \emph{parameter variable}.  It is an instance of
a \emph{dummy variable}. In other words, $t$ is a placeholder---just because ``$t$'' appears in two different vector
forms, doesn't mean it's the same quantity.

To drive this point home, we need to remember that vector
form is shorthand for a set described in set-builder notation.

\bigskip
Let $\vec d_1,\vec d_2\neq\vec 0$ and $\vec p_1,\vec p_2$ be vectors and define the lines
\[
	\ell_1=\Set{\vec x\given \vec x=t\vec d_1+\vec p_1\text{ for some }t\in\R}
\]
\[
	\ell_2=\Set{\vec x\given \vec x=t\vec d_2+\vec p_2\text{ for some }t\in\R}.
\]
These lines have vector forms $\vec x=t\vec d_1+\vec p_1$ and $\vec x=t\vec d_2+\vec p_2$.
However, declaring that $\ell_1=\ell_2$ if and only if $t\vec d_1+\vec p_1=t\vec d_2+\vec p_2$
does \emph{not} make sense.   Instead, as per the definition, $\ell_1=\ell_2$ if $\ell_1\subseteq\ell_2$ and $\ell_2\subseteq\ell_1$.
If $\vec x\in\ell_1$ then $\vec x=t\vec d_1+\vec p_1$ for some $t\in\R$.  If $\vec x\in\ell_2$
then $\vec x=t\vec d_2+\vec p_2$ for some \emph{possibly different} $t\in \R$.  This can get
confusing really quickly.  The easiest way to avoid confusion is to use different parameter variables 
when comparing different vector forms.

\begin{example}
	Determine if the lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$, given in vector form as 
	\[
		\vec x=t\mat{1\\1}+\mat{2\\1}\qquad\text{and}\qquad
		\vec x=t\mat{2\\2}+\mat{4\\3},
	\]
	are the same line.  
	
	To determine this, we need to figure out if $\vec x\in\ell_1$
	implies $\vec x\in \ell_2$ and if $\vec x\in\ell_2$ implies $\vec x\in\ell_1$.

	If $\vec x\in\ell_1$, then $\vec x=t\mat{1\\1}+\mat{2\\1}$ for some $t\in\R$.  If
	$\vec x\in\ell_2$, then $\vec x=s\mat{2\\2}+\mat{4\\3}$ for some $s\in \R$.  Thus if
	\[
		t\mat{1\\1}+\mat{2\\1} = \vec x = s\mat{2\\2}+\mat{4\\3}
	\]
	always has a solution, $\ell_1=\ell_2$.  Moving everything to one side we see
	\begin{align*}
		\vec 0 = \mat{4\\3}-\mat{2\\1} + s\mat{2\\2}-t\mat{1\\1}
		&=\mat{2\\2}+s\mat{2\\2}-t\mat{1\\1}\\
		&=(s+1)\mat{2\\2}-\tfrac{t}{2}\mat{2\\2}\\
		&= (s+1-\tfrac{t}{2})\mat{2\\2}.
	\end{align*}
	This has a solution whenever $0=s+1-t/2$.  Since for every $t\in\R$ we can find an $s\in\R$ satisfying
	this equation
	and for every $s\in \R$ we can find a $t\in \R$ satisfying this equation, we know $\ell_1=\ell_2$.
\end{example}


\Heading{Vector Form in Higher Dimensions}
The geometry of lines in space ($\R^3$ and above) is a bit more complicated than that of lines
in the plane.  Lines in the plane either intersect or are parallel.
In space,  we have to be a more careful about what we mean by
``parallel lines,'' since lines with entirely different directions can
still fail to intersect\footnote{ Recall that in Euclidean geometry
two lines are defined to be parallel if they coincide or never intersect.}.

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[grid=major,view={20}{40},z buffer=sort,

	%    ({x},{118.89/x},{2*x});
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{example}
Consider the lines described by
\begin{align*}
\vec x &= t( 1, 3, -2 ) + ( 1, 2, 1 ) \\
\vec x &= t( -2, -6, 4) + ( 3, 1, 0 ).
\end{align*}
They have parallel directions since $( -2, -6, 4 ) = -2( 1, 3,-2 )$.
Hence, in this case, we say the lines are \emph{parallel}\index{parallel lines}.  (How can
we be sure the lines are not the same?)
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Consider the lines described by
\begin{align*}
	\vec x &= t(1, 3, -2 ) + ( 1, 2, 1 ) \\
	\vec x &= t( 0, 2, 3) + ( 0, 3, 9 ).
\end{align*}
They are not parallel because neither of the direction
vectors is a multiple
of the other.  They may or may not intersect.  (If they don't,
	we say the lines are \emph{skew}\index{skew lines}.)  How can we find out?
	Mirroring our earlier approach,
	we can set their equations equal and see if we can solve for the point
	of intersection \emph{after ensuring we give their parametric variables
	different names}.   We'll keep one parametric variable named $t$ and name the
	other one $s$.  Thus, we want
\[
\vec x = t( 1, 3, -2 ) + ( 1, 2, 1 ) =
s( 0, 2, 3) + ( 0, 3, 9 ),
\]
which after collecting terms yields
\[
    ( t + 1, 3t + 2, -2t + 1 ) = ( 0, 2s + 3, 3s + 9).
\]
Picking out the components yields three equations
\begin{align*}
    t + 1 &= 0 \\
    3t +2 &= 2s + 3 \\
    -2t + 1 &=  3s + 9
\end{align*}
in 2 unknowns  $s$ and $t$.  This is an {\it overdetermined\/}
system, and it may or may not have a consistent solution.
The first two equations yield $t = -1$  and $s = -2$.  Putting
these values in the last equation yields $(-2)(-1) + 1 = 3(-2) + 9$,
which is indeed true.
Hence, the equations are consistent, and the lines
intersect.   To find the point of intersection, put $t = -1$
in the equation for the first line (or
$s = -2$ in that for the second) to obtain  $( 0, -1, 3 )$.
\end{example}

\Heading{Planes}

Any two distinct points define a line.  To define a plane, we
need three points.  But there's a caveat: the three points cannot
be on the same line, otherwise they'd define a line
and not a plane.  Let $A,B,C\in\R^3$ be three points that are not
collinear and let $\mathcal P$ be the plane that passes through $A$,
$B$, and $C$.

Just like lines, planes have direction vectors.  For $\mathcal P$, both
$\vec d_1=\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\vec d_2=\overrightarrow{AC}$ are direction
vectors for $\mathcal P$.  Of course, $\vec d_1$, $\vec d_2$ and their multiples
are not the only direction vectors for $\mathcal P$. There are infinitely many more, including
$\vec d_1+\vec d_2$, and $\vec d_1-7\vec d_2$, and so on.  However, since a plane
is a \emph{two}-dimensional object, we only need two different direction vectors to describe it.

Like lines, planes have a vector form.  Using the direction vectors $\vec d_1=\overrightarrow{AB}$ and 
$\vec d_2=\overrightarrow{AC}$,
the plane $\mathcal P$ can be written in vector form as
\[
	\mat{x\\y\\z} = t\vec d_1+s\vec d_2+A.
\]

\begin{example}
	Describe the plane $\mathcal P\subseteq \R^3$ with equation $z=2x+y+3$ in vector form.

	To describe $\mathcal P$ in vector form, we need a point on $\mathcal P$ and two direction
	vectors for $\mathcal P$. By guess-and-check, we see the points
	\[
		A=\mat{0\\0\\3}\qquad B=\mat{1\\0\\5}\qquad C=\mat{0\\1\\4}
	\]
	are all on $\mathcal P$. Thus
	\[
		\vec d_1=B-A=\mat{1\\0\\2}\qquad \text{and}\qquad
		\vec d_2=C-A=\mat{0\\1\\1}
	\]
	are both direction vectors for $\mathcal P$.  Therefore, we can express $\mathcal P$ in vector
	form as
	\[
		\vec x=t\vec d_1+s\vec d_2+A=t\mat{1\\0\\2}+s\mat{0\\1\\1}+\mat{0\\0\\3}.
	\]

\Heading{Restricted Linear Combinations}

Using vectors, we can describe more than just lines and planes---we can describe 
all sorts of geometric objects.

Recall that when we write $\vec x=t\vec d+\vec p$
to describe the line $\ell$,
what we mean is
\[
	\ell=\Set{\vec x\given \vec x=t\vec d+\vec p\text{ for some }t\in \R}.
\]
The line $\ell$ stretches off infinitely in both directions. But, what if we wanted
to describe just a part of $\ell$? We can do this by placing additional restrictions
on $t$.
For example, consider the ray $R$
and the line segment $S$:
\begin{align*}
	R&=\Set{\vec x\given \vec x=t\vec d+\vec p\text{ for some }t\geq 0}\\
	S&=\Set{\vec x\given \vec x=t\vec d+\vec p\text{ for some }t\in [0,2]}
\end{align*}

We can also make polygons by adding restrictions to the vector form of a plane. Let
$\vec a=\mat{2\\1}$ and $\vec b=\mat{-1\\1}$ and consider the unit square $U$ and
the parallelogram $P$ defined by
\begin{align*}
	U&=\Set{\vec x\given \vec x=t\xhat+s\yhat\text{ for some }t,s\in [0,1]}\\
	P&=\Set{\vec x\given \vec x=t\vec a+s\vec b\text{ for some }t\in [0,1]\text{ and }s\in[-1,1]}
\end{align*}

Each set so far is a set of linear combinations, and we 
have made different shapes by restricting the coefficients of those linear
combinations. There are two ways of restricting linear combinations that arise
up often enough to get their own names.

\SavedDefinitionRender{NonnegativeConvexLinearCombinations}

You can think of a non-negative linear combinations as vector you can arrive at by
only displacing ``forward'' along your vectors.
Convex linear combinations can be thought of as weighted averages of vectors (the average of $\vec v_1,\ldots,
\vec v_n$ would be the convex linear combination with coefficients $\alpha_i=\frac{1}{n}$). 
A convex linear combination
of two vectors gives a point on the line segment connecting them. 

\begin{example}
	Let $\vec a=\mat{2\\1}$ and $\vec b=\mat{-1\\1}$ and define
	\begin{align*}
		A&=\Set{\vec x\given \vec x\text{ is a convex linear combination of }\vec a\text{ and }\vec b}\\
		&=\Set{\vec x\given \vec x=\alpha\vec a+(1-\alpha)\vec b\text{ for some }\alpha\in [0,1]}.
	\end{align*}
	Draw $A$.
