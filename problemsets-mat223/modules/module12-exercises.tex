\begin{exercises}
	\begin{problist}
		\prob Determine whether the following linear transformations are
		one-to-one, onto, or both. As well, determine whether or not they are
		invertible. Justify your answers.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $\mathcal S:\R^{2}\to\R^{2}$, where $\mathcal S$
				is the linear transformation that doubles every
				vector.

			\item $\mathcal R:\R^{2}\to\R^{2}$, where $\mathcal R$
				the linear transformation that rotates every
				vector clockwise by $72^{\circ}$.

			\item $\mathcal P:\R^{2}\to\R^{2}$, where $\mathcal P$
				the linear transformation that projects every
				vector onto the $y$-axis.

			\item $\mathcal F:\R^{2}\to\R^{2}$, where $\mathcal F$
				is the linear transformation that reflects every
				vector over the line $y=x$.

			\item $\mathcal T:\R^{3}\to\R^{3}$, where $\mathcal T$ is the linear
				transformation induced by the matrix
				$M_{\mathcal T} = \mat{1&2&3\\4&5&6\\7&8&9}$.

			\item $\mathcal U:\R^{3}\to\R^{2}$, where $\mathcal U$ is the linear
				transformation induced by the matrix
				$M_{\mathcal U} = \mat{1&2&3\\3&4&5}$.
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{solution}
	    \begin{enumerate}
				\item
				$\mathcal S$ is both one-to-one and onto.
				No two distinct vectors can be doubled to become the same vector,
				thus the transformation is one-to-one.
				Every vector is double of the vector that is half of itself,
				thus the transformation is onto.
				$\mathcal S$ is invertible, its inverse is the transformation that
				halves every vector.

				\item
				$\mathcal R$ is both one-to-one and onto.
				No two distinct vectors can be rotated by $72^{\circ}$ clockwise to
				become the same vector,
				thus the transformation is one-to-one.
				Every vector is the $72^{\circ}$ clockwise rotation of the vector that
				is the $72^{\circ}$ counter-clockwise rotation of itself,
				thus the transformation is onto.
				$\mathcal R$ is invertible, its inverse is the transformation that
				rotates every vector counter-clockwise by $72^{\circ}$.

				\item
				$\mathcal P$ is neither one-to-one nor onto.
				Every vector on the x-axis is sent to the origin so there are distinct
				inputs that do not map to distinct outputs,
				thus the transformation is not one-to-one.
				Vectors that do not lie on the y-axis are not in the range of the
				transformation,
				thus the transformation is not onto.
				$\mathcal P$ is not invertible.

				\item
				$\mathcal F$ is both one-to-one and onto.
				No two distinct vectors can be reflected to become the same vector,
				thus the transformation is one-to-one.
				Every vector is the reflection of the vector that is the reflection of
				itself,
				thus the transformation is onto.
				$\mathcal F$ is invertible, its inverse is itself---the reflection about
				the line $y=x$.

				\item
				$\mathcal T$ is neither one-to-one nor onto.
				The RREF of $M_{\mathcal T}$ is $\mat{1&0&-1\\0&1&0\\0&0&0}$.
				$\Rank(\mathcal T)$ = $\Rank(M_{\mathcal T})$ = 2.
				by the Rank-Nullity Theorem the nullity is 1.
				An entire line of vectors is getting mapped to
				$\vec{0}$ so there are distinct inputs that do not map to distinct
				outputs,
				thus the transformation is not one-to-one.
				The range of $\mathcal T$ = the column space of $M_{\mathcal T}$
				which is not all of $\R^{3}$,
				Thus the transformation is not onto.
				$\mathcal T$ is not invertible.

				\item
				$\mathcal U$ is onto but is not one-to-one
				Because $\mathcal U$ maps from $\R^{3}$ to $\R^{2}$ the rank is at most
				2 so by the Rank-Nullity Theorem, the nullity must be at least 1. More
				than one vector is getting mapped to $\vec{0}$ so there are distinct
				inputs that do not map to distinct outputs,
				thus the transformation is not one-to-one.
				The RREF of $M_{\mathcal U}$ is $\mat{1&0&-1\\0&1&2}$.
				$\Rank(\mathcal U)$ = $\Rank(M_{\mathcal U})$ = 2 which is
				the dimension of the codomain,
				thus the transformation is onto.
				$\mathcal U$ is not invertible.

		\prob Invert the following matrices or explain why they are not invertible.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $M_{1} = \mat{2&3\\1&-1}$.

			\item $M_{2} = \mat{1&0\\1&0}$.

			\item $M_{3} = \mat{0&2&1\\1&0&1\\-2&3&0}$.

			\item $M_{4} = \mat{2&0&1&8\\1&-5&2&2\\3&-1&0&7}$.

			\item $M_{5} = \mat{0&-3&1&2\\1&0&-1&1\\2&-1&0&0\\0&0&1&3}$.
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{solution}
	    \begin{enumerate}
				\item
				To find the inverse we row reduce $M_{1}$, applying each
				of the row operations to the identity matrix.

				$\left[\begin{array}{cc|cc}
							2&3&-1&0\\
							1&-1&0&1\\
							\end{array}\right]$

				$\left[\begin{array}{cc|cc}
							1&\frac{3}{2}&\frac{1}{2}&0\\
							1&-1&0&1\\
							\end{array}\right]$

				$\left[\begin{array}{cc|cc}
							1&\frac{3}{2}&\frac{1}{2}&0\\
							0&-\frac{5}{2}&-\frac{1}{2}&1\\
							\end{array}\right]$

				$\left[\begin{array}{cc|cc}
							1&\frac{3}{2}&\frac{1}{2}&0\\
							0&1&\frac{1}{5}&-\frac{2}{5}\\
							\end{array}\right]$

				$\left[\begin{array}{cc|cc}
							1&0&\frac{7}{10}&\frac{3}{5}\\
							0&1&\frac{1}{5}&-\frac{2}{5}\\
							\end{array}\right]$

				So $M_{1}^{-1}=\mat{\frac{7}{10}&\frac{3}{5}\\
								 \frac{1}{5}&-\frac{2}{5}\\}$.
				\item $\Rank(M_{2})=1\neq2$ so $M_{2}$ is not invertible.
				\item $M_{3}^{-1}=\mat{3&-3&-2\\2&-2&-1\\-3&4&2}$
				\item $M_{4}$ is not invertible because it is not a square matrix.
				\item $M_{5}^{-1}=\frac{1}{23}\mat{-4&-1&12&3\\-8&-2&1&6\\-3&-18&9&8\\1&6&-3&5}$
