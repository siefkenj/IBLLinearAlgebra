\section*{About the Document}

This document is a hybrid of many linear algebra resources, including those of
the IOLA (Inquiry Oriented Linear Algebra) project and Jason Siefken's
IBL Linear Algebra project.

This document is a mix of short problems and more involved exploratory question. A typical
class day looks like:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf Introduction by instructor.} This may involve giving a definition,
		a broader context for the day's topics, or answering questions.

	\item {\bf Students work on problems.} Students work individually or in pairs/small groups
		on the prescribed problem. During this time the instructor moves
		around the room addressing questions that students may have and giving
		one-on-one coaching.

	\item {\bf Instructor intervention.} When most students have successfully solved
		the problem, the instructor refocuses the class by providing an
		explanation or soliciting explanations from students.
		This is also time for the instructor to ensure that everyone has
		understood the main point of the exercise (since it is sometimes
		easy to miss the point!).

		If students are having trouble, the instructor can give hints
		and additional guidance to ensure students' struggle is productive.

	\item {\bf Repeat step 2.}
\end{enumerate}

Using this format, students are thinking (and happily so) most of the class. Further,
after struggling with a question, students are especially primed to hear the insights of the instructor.

These problems are geared towards concepts instead of computation, though some problems
focus on simple computation. The questions also have a geometric lean. Vectors are initially
introduced with familiar coordinate notation, but eventually, coordinates are understood to be
\emph{representations} of vectors rather than ``true'' geometric vectors, and objects like the
determinant are defined via oriented volumes rather than formulas involving matrix entries.

\begin{module}
	\Title{Sets, Vectors \& Notation}

	In this module you will learn
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The basics of sets and set-builder notation.
		\item The definition of vectors and how they relate to points.
		\item Column vector notation and to how represent vectors in drawings.
		\item How to compute linear combinations of vectors and use systems of linear
			equations to answer questions about linear combinations of vectors.

	\Title{Linear Combinations}

	\Heading{Textbook}
	Module 1

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Internalize vectors as geometric objects representing displacements.

		\item Use column vector notation to write vectors.

		\item Relate points and vectors and be able to interpret a point as
			a vector and a vector as a point.

		\item Solve simple equations involving vectors.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation} Students have differing levels of experience with vectors.
	We want to establish a common notation for vectors and use vector notation
	along with algebra to solve simple questions. E.g., ``How can I get to location
	$A$ given that I can only walk parallel to the lines $y=4x$ and $y=-x$?''


	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item
			We will use the language \emph{component of $\vec v$ in
			the direction $\vec u$} in the future and it will be a \emph{vector}.
			For this reason, try to refer to the entries of a column
			vector as \emph{coordinates} or \emph{entries} instead of components.

			\item
			Though we will almost exclusively use
			column vector notation in this course, students should be able to parse
			questions phrased in terms of row vectors.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}We will use column vector notation and the idea of equating
	coordinates in order to solve problems.

You are a young adventurer. Having spent most of your time in the mythical city of Oronto,
	you decide to leave home for the first time. Your parents
want to help you on your journey, so just before your departure, they give you two
gifts. Specifically, they give you two forms of transportation: a hover board and
a magic carpet. Your parents inform you that both the hover board and the magic carpet
have restrictions in how they operate:

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
	\vspace{.5cm}
	\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1in}
	\vspace{-.8cm}
	\includegraphics[width=1in]{images/HoverBoard-small.png}
	\end{wrapfigure}

	We denote the restriction on the hover board's movement by the vector
	$\mat{3 \\1}$. By this we mean that if
	the hover board traveled ``forward'' for one hour, it would move along a
	``diagonal'' path that would result in a displacement of 3 km East and
	1 km North of its starting location.
\end{minipage}

	\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1in}
	\vspace{-.8cm}
	\includegraphics[width=1in]{images/MagicCarpet-small.png}
	\end{wrapfigure}

	We denote the restriction on the magic carpet's movement by the vector
	$\mat{1 \\2 }$. By this we mean that if the
	magic carpet traveled ``forward'' for one hour, it would move along a
	``diagonal'' path that would result in a displacement of 1 km East and
	2 km North of its starting location.

% Scenario Section
\textbf{Scenario One: The Maiden Voyage}

Your Uncle Cramer suggests that your first adventure should be to go visit
the wise man, Old Man Gauss. Uncle Cramer tells you that Old Man Gauss
lives in a cabin that is 107 km East and 64 km North of your home.

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Task:}
\par
Investigate whether or not you can use the hover board and the magic
carpet to get to Gauss's cabin. If so, how? If it is not possible to
get to the cabin with these modes of transportation, why is that the case?

%\vspace{5mm}
% As a group, state and explain your answer(s) on the group whiteboard. Use
% the vector notation for each mode of transportation as part of your
% explanation and use a diagram or graphic to help illustrate your
% point(s).
\end{iola}

\begin{lesson}
	\Title{Linear Combinations}

	\Heading{Textbook}
	Module 1

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Set up and solve vector equations $a\vec v+b\vec u=\vec w$. The solving
			method may be ad hoc.
		\item Use set notation and set operations/relations $\cup$, $\cap$, $\in$, $\subseteq$.
		\item Translate between set-builder notation and words in multiple ways.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	We revisit questions about linear combinations more formally and generate a need for
	algebra. The algebra we do to solve vector equations will become algorithmic when
	we learn row reduction, but at the moment, any method is fine.

	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			You will have a mix of MAT135/136 and MAT137 students.
			The MAT137 students will be doing logic and sets in their
			class. The MAT135 students won't. Make sure not to leave them
			behind!
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}
	As we talk about more complex objects, we need precise ways to talk about
	groups of vectors. I.e., we need sets and set-builder notation. This preview of set-builder
	notation will take some of the difficulty away when we define span as a set of vectors.

	In this course we will be using formal and precise language. Part of this lesson
	is that there are multiple correct ways (and multiple incorrect ways) to use formal
	language. Gone are the days of ``there's only one right answer and it is 4''!

\question

\begin{annotation}
	\begin{goals}
		\Goal{Address an existential question involving vectors: ``Is it possible
		to find a linear combination that does\ldots?''}

		The goal of this problem is to
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Formalize geometric questions using the language of vectors.
			\item Find both geometric and algebraic arguments to support the same
				conclusion.
			\item Establish what a ``negative multiple'' of a vector should be.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{goals}
	\begin{notes}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Both \emph{yes} and \emph{no} are valid answers to
				this question depending on whether you are allowed
				to go backwards. Establish that ``negative'' multiples of
				a vector mean traveling backwards along that vector.
			\item This problem can be solved with algebra by finding a formula
				for the coefficients for an arbitrary position or with geometry,
				with arguments eventually hinging on the fact that non-parallel
				lines do not intersect.

\textbf{Scenario Two: Hide-and-Seek}

Old Man Gauss wants to move to a cabin in a different location. You are
not sure whether Gauss is just trying to test your wits at finding him
or if he actually wants to hide somewhere that you can't visit him.

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Are there some locations that he can hide and you cannot reach him
with these two modes of transportation?}

Describe the places that you
can reach using a combination of the hover board and the magic carpet and
those you cannot. Specify these geometrically and algebraically. Include
a symbolic representation using vector notation. Also, include a convincing
argument supporting your answer.

	\Title{Visualizing Sets, Formal Language of Linear Combinations}

	\Heading{Textbook}
	Module 1

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Draw pictures of formally-described subsets of $\R^2$.
		\item Graphically represent $\cup$ and $\cap$ for subsets of $\R^2$.
		\item Graphically represent linear combinations and then come up with
			algebraic arguments to support graphical intuition.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}

	We want to build a bridge between the formal language of linear combinations
	and set-builder notation and geometric intuition. Where as last time
	the focus was on formal language, this time the focus is on linking geometry
	to formal descriptions.

	Let $\vec v_1=\mat{1\\1}$, $\vec v_2=\mat{1\\-1}$, and $\vec w=2\vec v_1+\vec v_2$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Write $\vec w$ as a column vector. When $\vec w$ is written as a
			linear combination of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$, what are the
			coefficients of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$?
			\begin{solution}
				$\vec w=\mat{3\\2}$; the coefficients are $(2,1)$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Is $\mat{3\\3}$ a linear combination of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$?
			\begin{solution}[inline]
				Yes. $\mat{3\\3}=3\vec v_1+0\vec v_2$.
			\end{solution}

		\item Is $\mat{0\\0}$ a linear combination of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$?
			\begin{solution}[inline]
				Yes. $\vec 0=0\vec v_1+0\vec v_2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Is $\mat{4\\0}$ a linear combination of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$?
			\begin{solution}[inline]
				Yes. $\mat{4\\0}=2\vec v_1+2\vec v_2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Can you find a vector in $\R^2$ that isn't a linear combination of
		$\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$?
			\begin{solution}
				No. $\mat{1\\0}=\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_1+\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_2$ and
				$\mat{0\\1}=\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_1-\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_2$.
				Therefore
				\[
					\mat{a\\b}
					= a\mat{1\\0}+b\mat{0\\1}
					= a(\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_1+\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_2)
						+b(\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_1-\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_2)
					=(\tfrac{a+b}{2})\vec v_1+(\tfrac{a-b}{2})\vec v_2.
				\]
				Therefore any vector in $\R^2$ can be written as linear combinations
				of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Can you find a vector in $\R^2$ that isn't a linear combination of
			$\vec v_1$?
			\begin{solution}
				Yes. All linear combinations of $\vec v_1$ have equal $x$ and

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Read and digest a new definition.

		\item Use pictures to explore a new concept.

		\item Convert from an equation-representation of a line to a set-representation.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation} Part of doing math in the world is reading and understanding
	other people's definitions. Most students will not have heard of non-negative
	linear combinations or convex linear combinations. This is a chance for them
	to read and try to understand these formal definitions. They will need to
	draw pictures to gain intuition about what these concepts mean.

	These concepts are useful in their own right, and in particular, convex linear
	combinations can be used to describe line segments. Adding these definitions
	to a student's toolbox serves the goal of \emph{being able to describe
	the world with mathematics}.

	To that end, we start working with lines. Lines are something students have
	used since grade school, but they worked with them in $y=mx+b$ form which
	is only applicable in $\R^{2}$. We want to convert this representation
	into vector form and set-based descriptions which apply to all
	dimensions.

	\Title{Vector Form of Lines, Intersecting Lines}

	\Heading{Textbook}
	Module 2

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fluency with vector form of a line in $\R^2$ and $\R^3$.
		\item Recognize that vector form of a line is not unique.
		\item Find the intersection of two lines in vector form.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	A single linear equation cannot describe a line in more than two dimensions.
	One way to describe a line that works in all dimensions is vector form, which
	is a shorthand for a particular set. Vector form has the upside that it makes it easy
	to produce points on a line, but it has the downside that it is not unique.

	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			Giving a proper definition of vector form of a line is awkward and
			shouldn't be the focus. For vector form, that they ``know it when they see it''
			and can ``produce it'' is good enough. (This is in contrast to other definitions
			which they must be able to correctly state).
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}
	Vector form works because a line in any dimension can be defined by two
	points or, equivalently, a point and a direction. Though we don't yet have
	a systematic way to write solutions to a system of linear equations,
	if we have a system representing a line, all we need to do is guess two
	solutions to that system to find vector form of the line.


	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			The biggest stumbling block for finding the intersection of two lines
			in vector form will be choosing different dummy variables before
			setting the lines equal.
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}
	One thing vector form makes difficult is finding intersections, but intersections
	can be turned into just another algebra problem involving a system of equations.

	\begin{parts}
		\item Write $\ell$ in vector form. Is vector form of $\ell$ unique?
			\begin{solution}
				$\vec x = t \mat{1 \\ -2} + \mat{0 \\ 3}$

				The vector form is not unique, as any non-zero scalar multiple of
				$\mat{1 \\ -2}$ can serve as a direction vector. Additionally,
				any other point on the line can be used in place of
				$\mat{0 \\3}$. For example,  $\vec x = t \mat{-4 \\ 8} + \mat{1 \\ 1}$
				is another vector form of $\ell$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Write $L$ in vector form.
			\begin{solution}[inline]
				$\vec x = t\mat{1 \\ -2 \\ -2} + \mat{0 \\ 3 \\ 3}$. This is obtained

			``$\vec p$'' are different from before.
			\begin{solution}
				$\vec x = t \mat{-3 \\ 6 \\ 6} + \mat{1 \\ 1 \\ 1}$.

		\item Do the lines $A$ and $B$ intersect? Justify your conclusion.
			\begin{solution}
				Yes. $(0)\mat{1\\2\\3}+\mat{0\\0\\1} = \mat{0\\0\\1} = (-1)\mat{-1\\1\\1}+\mat{-1\\1\\2}$.

				To find the intersection, if there is one, we must solve the vector equation:
				\[
					t\mat{1\\2\\3}+\mat{0\\0\\1} = s\mat{-1\\1\\1}+\mat{-1\\1\\2}.
				\]
				One solution is when $t = 0$ and $s = -1$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Do the lines $A$ and $C$ intersect? Justify your conclusion.
			\begin{solution}
				No. The vector equation
				\[
					t\mat{1\\2\\3}+\mat{0\\0\\1} = s\mat{2\\-1\\1}+\mat{1\\1\\1}
				\]
				has no solutions. This is equivalent to saying that the following
				system of equations has no solutions:
				\begin{gather*}
					t = 2s + 1 \\
					2t = -s + 1 \\
					3t + 1 = s + 1
				\end{gather*}
				The third equation tells us that $s = 3t$, which when substituted
				into the first equation forces $t = -\tfrac{1}{5}$ and therefore
				$s = -\tfrac{3}{5}$. However, these two numbers don't satisfy the second
				equation.
			\end{solution}
		\item Let $\vec p\neq \vec q$ and suppose
			$X$ has vector form $\vec x=t\vec d+\vec p$ and $Y$ has
			vector form $\vec x=t\vec d+\vec q$. Is it possible
			that $X$ and $Y$ intersect?
			\begin{solution}
				Yes. If $\vec q=\vec p+a\vec d$ for $a\neq 0$, then $X$ and $Y$
				will actually be the same line, since in this case
				\[
					\vec x = t\vec d+\vec q
					= t\vec d+(\vec p+a\vec d)
					= (t+a)\vec d+\vec p.
				\]

				For example, the following two vector equations represent the
				same line.
				\[
					\vec x = t \mat{1\\1\\1} + \mat{0\\0\\0}
					\qquad \text{and} \qquad
					\vec x = t \mat{1\\1\\1} + \mat{7\\7\\7}.

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Describe a plane in vector form.
		\item Visualize spans.
		\item Recognize the dimension of $\Span(X)$ is not necessarily how many vectors
			are in $X$.
		\item Define \emph{span}.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	Planes are just like lines but one dimension higher. Vector form of a plane is just like
	vector form of a line with all the advantages and disadvantages. But, we now have
	\emph{two} direction vectors.

	Spans are similar to lines and planes; $\Span\{\vec a,\vec b\}$ looks a lot like
	vector form of the plane
	$\vec x=t\vec a+s\vec b$. Except, $\Span\{\vec a,\vec b\}$ may not always be a plane.
	We haven't defined linear independence and linear dependence yet, but we will continue to
	foreshadow it by seeing that the dimension of the span of a set is not always the size of
	that set.

	Knowing definitions is an essential part of solving math problems. Span is
	the first definition that students will think they ``know'' but won't be
	able to write down.

			\Goal{Apply vector form of a plane.}

			The goal of this problem is to
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Use direction vectors for lines given in vector form.
				\item Think about planes in terms of vectors rather
					than equations.
				\item Combine direction vectors in a plane to produce new direction vectors.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{goals}

		\begin{notes}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Students may think they need to find the intersection
					of the lines to serve as their ``$\vec p$''.
					They don't. All they need is a point
					on the plane!

	Recall the intersecting lines $A$ and $B$ given in vector form by
	\[
		\overbrace{\vec x=t\mat{1\\2\\3}+\mat{0\\0\\1}}^{\displaystyle A}
		\qquad
		\overbrace{\vec x=t\mat{-1\\1\\1}+\mat{-1\\1\\2}}^{\displaystyle B}.
	\]
	Let $\mathcal P$ the plane that contains the lines $A$ and $B$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Find two direction vectors for $\mathcal P$.
			\begin{solution}
				Two possible answers are:
				\[
					\vec d_1 = \mat{1\\2\\3}
					\qquad \text{and} \qquad
					\vec d_2 = \mat{-1\\1\\1}.
				\]
				These are the two direction vectors we already know are in the
				plane---the ones from the two lines:

				Note that neither of these is a multiple of the other, so they
				really are two unique direction vectors in $\mathcal P$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Write $\mathcal P$ in vector form.
			\begin{solution}
				\[
					\vec x = t\vec d_1 +s\vec d_2+\vec p
					= t \mat{1\\2\\3} + s \mat{-1\\1\\1} + \mat{0\\0\\1}.
				\]
				We already have two direction vectors, so we just needed a point
				on the plane. We used the point $\vec p = \mat{0\\0\\1}$
				that we already know is on line $A$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Describe how vector form of a plane relates to linear
			combinations.
			\begin{solution}
				The vector form of a plane says that a vector $\vec x$ is on the
				plane exactly when it is equal to some linear combination of
				$\vec d_1$ and $\vec d_2$, plus $\vec p$.

				Another way of saying
				the same thing is that the vector $\vec x$ is on the plane
				exactly when $\vec x - \vec p$ is equal	to some linear
				combination of $\vec d_1$ and $\vec d_2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Write $\mathcal P$ in vector form using different
			direction vectors and a different point.
			\begin{solution}
				One possible answer:
				\[
					\vec x = t\mat{-1\\-2\\-3}+s\mat{-7\\7\\7}+\mat{-1\\1\\2}.
				\]
				As with the equations of lines from before, we can use any
				non-zero scalar multiple of either direction vector and get the
				same plane. We also used the point $\vec q = \mat{-1\\1\\2}$
				that we already knew is on line $B$.

	Let $\mathcal Q\subseteq \R^3$ be a plane with equation $x+y+z=1$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Find three points in $\mathcal Q$.
			\begin{solution}
				There are many choices here, of course. Three natural ones are:
				\[
					\vec p_1 = \mat{1\\0\\0}
					\qquad
					\vec p_2 = \mat{0\\1\\0}
					\qquad
					\vec p_3 = \mat{0\\0\\1}
				\]
			\end{solution}
		\item Find two direction vectors for $\mathcal Q$.
			\begin{solution}
				Now that we have three points on the plane, we can use the
				direction vectors joining any two pairs of them. For example:
				\[
					\vec d_1 = \vec p_1 - \vec p_2 = \mat{1\\-1\\0}
					\qquad
					\vec d_2 = \vec p_1 - \vec p_3 = \mat{1\\0\\-1}.
				\]
			\end{solution}
		\item Write $\mathcal Q$ in vector form.
			\begin{solution}
				Using the point $\vec p_1$ from above, one possible answer is:
				\[
					\vec x = t\vec d_1 + s\vec d_2 + \vec p_1
					= t \mat{1\\-1\\0} + s \mat{1\\0\\-1} + \mat{1\\0\\0}.

	the line with equation $x-y=4$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item If possible, describe $\ell_1$ as a span. Otherwise explain why
			it's not possible.
			\begin{solution}
				$\ell_1 = \Span\Set*{\mat{1\\1}}$, since $\mat{x\\y} \in \ell_1$
				if and only if $x = y$, which in turn is true if and only if it
				is a scalar multiple of $\mat{1\\1}$.
			\end{solution}
		\item If possible, describe $\ell_2$ as a span. Otherwise explain why it's
			not possible.
			\label{linesAsSpans.2}
			\begin{solution}
				This is not possible. $\mat{0\\0}$ is an element of	the span of
				\emph{any} set of vectors, since we can use all zeroes as the
				scalars in a linear combination, but $\mat{0\\0} \notin \ell_2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Does the expression $\Span(\ell_1)$ make sense? If so, what is it?
			How about $\Span(\ell_2)$?
			\begin{solution}
				Both of these expressions do make sense. One can compute the span
				of any set of vectors, and these lines are just special set of
				points in $\R^2$ which we are already used to thinking of as vectors.

				$\Span(\ell_1) = \ell_1$, since all of the vectors on
				the line $\ell_1$ are already multiples of $\mat{1\\1}$, as we
				discovered earlier.

				$\Span(\ell_2)$ equals all of $\R^2$. It's easy to see that the
				vectors $v = \mat{4\\0}$ and $w = \mat{0\\-4}$ are both on $\ell_2$,
				and the span of these two vectors alone is all of $\R^2$.

\begin{lesson}
	\Title{Linear Independence \& Dependence}

	\Heading{Textbook}
	Module 3

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define linear independence/dependence using spans.
		\item Pick linearly independent subsets with the same span by inspection.
		\item Explain why having a ``closed loop'' or trivial linear combination
			means a set is linearly dependent.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	Linear independence/dependence is one of the biggest concepts in linear algebra.
	Linear independence/dependence tells us whether a set has redundant information
	in it with respect to spans. The idea of a having redundant information vs\mbox{.}
	not comes up all the time in the world (sometimes it's a plus, sometimes it's not).

	Knowing
	a set is independent tells us what its span will look like (in terms of what dimension
	it will be). It is also an abstract concept that has both a ``geometric'' definition
	and an ``algebraic'' one.
	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			Don't define a linearly dependent \emph{set}, define
			a linearly dependent \emph{list}. Otherwise you cannot talk about
			$\mat{1\\1}$ and $\mat{1\\1}$ be linearly dependent since sets don't
			contain duplicates.
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}
	Geometrically, a set is linearly dependent if you can remove
	a vector without the span changing. Algebraically a set is linearly dependent if there
	is a non-trivial linear combination giving the zero vector. This lesson focuses on the
	geometric definition (with the algebraic definition coming next).

	Though the algebraic definition is easier to work with in proofs, the geometric definition
	provides intuition about how to visualize linearly
	dependent sets.

Suppose you are now in a three-dimensional world for the carpet

	\Title{Linear Independence \& Dependence---Equivalent Definitions}

	\Heading{Textbook}
	Module 3

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define linear independence/dependence in terms of trivial linear combinations.
		\item Explain how the geometric and algebraic definitions of linear independence/dependence relate.
		\item Explain the connection between a vector equation having multiple
			solutions and those vectors being linearly independent/dependent.
		\item Identify the largest linearly independent set that could exist in $\R^n$.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	We've done geometry, now let's do algebra. The geometric and algebraic definitions
	are equivalent, but they suggest different consequences. The geometric definition
	of linear independence tells us about the dimension of a span. The algebraic
	definition tells us about the number of solutions to a vector equation.

\end{lesson}

	We now have an equivalent definition of linear dependence.

		\item Explain how the geometric definition of linear dependence (original) implies this algebraic one (new).
			\begin{solution}
				Suppose that $\vec v_1, \vec v_2, \dots, \vec v_n$ are linearly
				dependent according to the geometric definition. Fix $i$ so that
				$\vec v_i\in \Span\Set{\vec v_1,\ldots,\vec v_{i-1},\vec v_{i+1},\ldots,\vec v_n}$.

				By the definition of $\Span$, we know that
				\[
					\vec v_i=\beta_1\vec v_1+\cdots +\beta_{i-1}\vec v_{i-1}+\beta_{i+1}\vec v_{i+1}
					+\cdots +\beta_n\vec v_{n}.
				\]
				Thus
				\[
					\vec 0 = -\vec v_i+\beta_1\vec v_1+\cdots +\beta_{i-1}\vec v_{i-1}+\beta_{i+1}\vec v_{i+1}
					+\cdots +\beta_n\vec v_{n},
				\]
				and this is a non-trivial linear combination since the coefficient of $\vec v_i$ is $-1\neq 0$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Explain how this algebraic definition of linear dependence (new) implies the geometric one (original).
			\begin{solution}
				Suppose the vectors $\vec v_1, \vec v_2, \dots, \vec v_n$ is
				linearly dependent in this new sense. That means there are
				scalars	$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, at least one of which is non-zero,
				such that
				\[
					a_1 \vec v_1 + \cdots + a_n \vec v_n = 0.
				\]
				Suppose $a_i\neq 0$. Then
				\[
					\vec v_i = \tfrac{-a_1}{a_i}\vec v_1+\cdots +\tfrac{-a_{i-1}}{a_i}\vec v_{i-1}
					+\tfrac{-a_{i+1}}{a_i}\vec v_{i+1}+\cdots+\tfrac{-a_n}{a_i}\vec v_n.
				\]
				This means $\vec v_i\in \Span\Set{\vec v_1,\ldots,\vec v_{i-1},\vec v_{i+1},\ldots,\vec v_n}$,
				which is precisely the geometric definition of linear dependence.
			\end{solution}
	\end{parts}

	Since we have geometric def $\implies$ algebraic def, and algebraic def $\implies$ geometric def
	($\implies$ should be read aloud as `implies'), the two definitions
	are \emph{equivalent} (which we write as algebraic def $\iff$ geometric def).

					Yes. $\mat{0\\2\\-4}$ is one possibility.

					To see this, note that any such vector $\vec x$ is of the form

						= \matc{t-s\\t+s\\-3t-s},

					\[
						\vec u \cdot \vec x = (1)(t-s) + (2)(t+s) + (1)(-3t-s) = 0,

				$\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \vec u = \mat{\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\\\frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}}$.

				$\norm{\vec u} = \sqrt{6}$, and so if we multiply $\vec u$ by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}$,

			\end{solution}
		\item Does there exist a \emph{unit vector} $\vec x$ that is distance
			$1$ from $\vec u$?
			\begin{solution}
				No. $\norm{\vec u} = \sqrt{6}$, and so the shortest length that a
				vector whose distance from $\vec u$ is 1 can have is $\sqrt{6} - 1$,
				which is greater than 1.
			\end{solution}
		\item Suppose $\vec y$ is a unit vector and the distance between $\vec y$
			and	$\vec u$ is $2$. What is the angle between $\vec y$ and $\vec u$?
			\begin{solution}
				The angle between $\vec u$ and $\vec y$ is $\arccos\left(\frac{3}{2\sqrt{6}}\right)$.

				By assumption, $2=\norm{\vec u-\vec y}$, and so
				\begin{align*}
					4 &= \norm{\vec u-\vec y}^2\\
					&= (\vec u-\vec y)\cdot(\vec u-\vec y)\\
					&= \vec u\cdot\vec u - 2(\vec u\cdot\vec y) + \vec y\cdot\vec y\\
					&=\norm{\vec u}^2 - 2\vec u\cdot\vec y + \norm{\vec y}^2\\
					&=6 - 2\vec u\cdot\vec y + 1.
				\end{align*}
				Then we rearrange to find that $\vec u\cdot \vec y = \frac{3}{2}$.

				Using this in the second definition of the dot product, we see:
				\[
					\frac{3}{2} = \left(\sqrt{6}\right)(1) \cos \theta,
				\]
				where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec u$ and $\vec y$.

		\item Find two vectors orthogonal to $\vec a=\mat{1\\-3}$.  Can you find
			two such vectors that are not parallel?
			\begin{solution}
				Two such vectors are $\mat{3\\1}$ and $\mat{-6\\-2}$.

				It is impossible for two non-parallel vectors to both be
				orthogonal to $\vec a$. If $\vec b = \mat{x\\y}$ is orthogonal to
				$\vec a$, then we must have that $x - 3y = 0$, or in other words
				that $x = 3y$. Any $\vec b$ satisfying this is a multiple of
				$\mat{3\\1}$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Find two vectors orthogonal to $\vec b=\mat{1\\-3\\4}$.  Can you
			find two such vectors that are not parallel?
			\begin{solution}
				Two such vectors are $\mat{7\\1\\-1}$ and $\mat{2\\2\\1}$.

				These two vectors are not parallel.
			\end{solution}
		\item Suppose $\vec x$ and $\vec y$ are orthogonal to each other and
			$\norm{\vec x}=5$ and $\norm{\vec y}=3$. What is the distance between
			$\vec x$ and $\vec y$?
			\begin{solution}
				The distance between them must be $\sqrt{34}$.

				One way to see this is with Pythagoras' theorem. Two perpendicular
				line segments of lengths 3 and 5 form the two shorter sides of a
				right angle triangle, and so the length of the third side is
				$\sqrt{5^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{34}$.

				An equivalent way to see this is to use what we know about dot
				products to calculate $\norm{\vec x-\vec y}$ as follows:
				\[
					\norm{\vec x-\vec y} = \sqrt{(\vec x-\vec y)\cdot(\vec x-\vec y)}
					= \sqrt{\norm{\vec x}^2 - 2(\vec x\cdot\vec y) + \norm{\vec y}^2}
					= \sqrt{5^2 + 2(0) + 3^2},
				\]
				where in the last step we've used the fact that $\vec x$ and $\vec y$
				are orthogonal, so $\vec x\cdot\vec y = 0$.

		\item Project a vector onto lines and finite sets.
		\item Find the vector components of one vector in terms of another.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	Projection of a vector onto a set, defined as the closet point in the
	set to the vector, is a general operation used outside of linear algebra.
	However, in the land of linear algebra, we have exact formulas for the
	projection of a vector onto particular sets (e.g., subspaces). 
	Projections are a chance to explore a seemingly simple definition
	and see it relate to sets, lines, normal form, and vector form.

	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			In this class, we don't write $\Proj_{\vec v}\vec u$,
			i.e., the projection of one vector onto another. We
			instead call this $\Comp_{\vec v}\vec u$. We do this so
			as not to confuse $\Proj_{\{\vec v\}}\vec u$ and
			$\Comp_{\vec v}\vec u$. One is projection onto a singleton.
			The other is $\frac{\vec u\cdot \vec v}{\vec v\cdot \vec v}\vec v$.
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}
	$\Comp_{\vec v}\vec u$ is the vector component of a vector in the direction of another,
	which is sometimes called the ``projection'' of $\vec u$ onto $\vec v$ (but we're not using
	this terminology!). It relates
	to how much one vector points in the direction of another and
	provides a decomposition of vectors in terms of orthogonal components.

				\item Pick an appropriate representation of a line to solve a projection problem.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{goals}
		\begin{notes}

				\item Projections will be new and strange. Some students will be familiar with

				\item When visualizing projections, it is often better to draw vectors as dots instead

				\item General projections have no formula. This might make students unhappy, but it's an

				$\Proj_{\Set{\vec a,\vec b}}\vec v=\vec a$. We can simply compute

			\item	Philosophically, a subspace should be defined

			\item Some people define a subspace as a set containing
			$\vec 0$ and satisfying closure. We define a subspace
			as a non-empty set satisfying closure. We won't be trying
			to trick students by asking if an empty set is a subspace,
			so don't belabor the point.
			\item Proving a set is a subspace is one of the few proofs

	Subspaces give a mathematically precise definition of a ``flat space through the origin.''

	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{goals}
			\Goal{Visualizing subspaces.}

			The goal of this problem is to
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Read and apply the definition of subspace.
				\item Identify from a picture whether or not a set is a subspace.
				\item Write formal arguments showing whether or not certain sets are subspaces.
			\end{itemize}

		\begin{notes}
			Every part of this problem highlights a misconception or builds an abstraction.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item[1.] Satisfies (i) but not (ii).
				\item[2.] Looks fairly flat, but violates (i) and (ii) in a specific way.
				\item[3.] First subspace.
				\item[4.] Looks flat, but violates (i) and (ii).
				\item[5.] Satisfies (ii) but not (i).
				\item[6.] Second subspace.
				\item[7.] Alternate notation which requires unpacking a definition.
				\item[8.] Abstractly defined subspace requires an abstract proof.
			\end{enumerate}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Proving a set is a subset is one of the few \emph{proofs} we hold
					students accountable for, and they need practice. Remind them
					that to prove something is not a subspace they only need to
					prove that one condition is violated, and this can be done with
					an example. However, to prove something is a subspace, we need
					to make an argument about every single vector.
				\item Subspace proofs can follow a template. ``Let $\vec u,\vec v\in X$ and
					let $\alpha$ be a scalar. By definition \ldots, and so \ldots''. Let
					students try to write a proof on their own. Then, give them
					the template. Applying the template is harder than it seems, so
					emphasize for every subspace proof how it fits the template.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define Basis.
		\item Define Dimension.
		\item Find a basis for a subspace.
		\item Find the dimension of a subspace.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	Bases are sets of just enough vectors to describe every vector in a subspace.
	An additional consequence of a basis is that every vector can be \emph{uniquely}
	represented as a linear combination of basis vectors. Using this fact we
	will be able to consider objects in multiple different coordinate systems. However,
	now is the time to get familiar with what a basis is and how to find one.

	Dimension ties the abstract notion of subspace to our intuition about
	Euclidean space. We already know a plane in $\R^3$ is two dimensional,
	but now we know where that number \emph{two} comes from.

		\item Is $\Span\Set{\vec u,\vec v}$ a basis for $V$?  Why or why not?
			\begin{solution}
				No. $\Span\Set{\vec u,\vec v}$ is an infinite set of vectors
				which includes $\vec 0$, so it cannot be linearly independent and
				therefore isn't a basis.
			\end{solution}
		\item What is the dimension of $V$?
			\begin{solution}
				A basis for $V$ has two vectors so it is two-dimensional. We also
				know this because $V$ is the $xy$-plane in $\R^3$ and all planes

		\item Is $P\cap Q$ a subspace? If so, give a basis for it and its dimension.
			\begin{solution}
				Yes. $\Set{\vec b}$ is a basis for $P\cap Q$, and so its dimension is 1.

				$P$ and $Q$ are both planes and are not parallel (since
				$\vec a,\vec b,\vec c$ are linearly independent). The intersection
				of any two non-parallel	planes in $\R^3$ is a line.

				No. For example $\vec a$ and $\vec c$ are both in $P\cup Q$, but
				$\vec a+\vec c \notin P\cup Q$.

				Proof: A vector is in $P\cup Q$ if it is in $P$ or $Q$, so we must show
				that $\vec a+\vec c\notin P$ and $\vec a+\vec c\notin Q$

				$\vec a+\vec c \notin P$ since if it were, we would also have
				$(\vec a+\vec c)-\vec a=\vec c\in P$. We know this is impossible
				since the vectors $\vec a,\vec b,\vec c$ are linearly independent,
				and so $\vec c$ does not equal a linear combination of $\vec a$
				and $\vec b$.

				An analogous argument shows that $\vec a+\vec c \notin Q$.

		\item Write a vector in multiple bases.
		\item Explain what the notation $[\vec v]_{\mathcal B}$ means.
		\item Explain what the notation $\mat{a\\b\\c}_{\mathcal B}$ means.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	One of the most useful ideas in linear algebra is that you can
	represent a vector, a geometric object, with a list of numbers. This
	is done by picking a basis. So far we've implicitly used the standard basis,
	but now we're going to use other bases.

	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			So far, we have written $\mat{1\\1}$ to mean
			$\mat{1\\1}_{\mathcal E}$ where $\mathcal E$ is the
			standard basis. We will continue to do this as convenient,
			but if multiple bases are ever involved, we will be careful
			to specify the basis.
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}
	Now lists of numbers can mean many different things and can be identified
	with vectors in many ways, so we need some notation to keep things straight.
	It's important now to distinguish when something is a list of numbers (a matrix)
	and when it is a vector. This distinction will arise again when
	we talk about linear transformations and their matrix representations.

	The mythical town of Oronto is not aligned with the usual
	compass directions. The streets are laid out as follows:

\begin{center}

	    \foreach \ival in {-6,...,6} {
	    	\edef\temp{\noexpand\draw[blue!50!white] (-8-0.6*\ival,-6+0.8*\ival) -- (8-0.6*\ival,6+.8*\ival);}

	  \fill[fill=black] (4,0) circle[radius=1pt];

	Instead, every street is parallel to the vector
	$\vec d_1=\frac{1}{5}\mat{4\text{ east}\\3\text{ north}}$ or
	$\vec d_2=\tfrac{1}{5}\mat{-3\text{ east}\\4\text{ north}}$. The center of
	town is City Hall at $\vec 0=\mat{0\text{ east}\\0\text{ north}}$.

	Locations in Oronto are typically specified in \emph{street coordinates}. That
	is, as a pair $(a,b)$ where $a$ is how far you walk along streets in the $\vec d_1$ direction
	and $b$ is how far you walk in the $\vec d_2$ direction, provided you start at city hall.

	\begin{parts}
		\item The points $A=(2,1)$ and $B=(3,-1)$ are given in street coordinates.
			Find their east-north coordinates.
			\begin{solution}
				$A=(1,2)$ and $B=(3,1)$ in east-north coordinates.

				We obtain $A$ for example by finding the vector $2\vec d_1+\vec d_2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item The points $X=(4,3)$ and $Y=(1,7)$ are given in east-north coordinates.
			Find their street coordinates.
			\begin{solution}[inline]
				$X=(5,0)$ and $Y=(5,5)$ in street coordinates.

		\item Define $\vec e_1=\mat{1\text{ east}\\0\text{ north}}$ and
			$\vec e_2=\mat{0\text{ east}\\1\text{ north}}$.
			Does $\Span\Set{\vec e_1,\vec e_2} = \Span\Set{\vec d_1,\vec d_2}$?
			\begin{solution}
				Yes. Both of these sets spans all of $\R^2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Notice that $Y=5\vec d_1+5\vec d_2 = \vec e_1+7\vec e_2$. Is the point $Y$
			better represented by the pair $(5,5)$ or by the pair $(1,7)$? Explain.
			\begin{solution}
				It is equally well represented by either pair. For example, the
				street coordinates might be more useful for a resident of Oronto,
				while the east-north coordinates might be more useful for someone
				looking at Oronto on a world map.

			\begin{solution}
				$X = \mat{2&5\\1&3}$ is such a matrix.

				We know $X$ must be a $2\times2$ matrix, so suppose $X=\mat{a&b\\c&b}$

					X\mat{0\\1}=\mat{5\\3}.
				\]
				But $X\mat{1\\0}=\mat{a\\c}$ and $X\mat{0\\1}=\mat{b\\d}$, so we

			\begin{solution}
				$Y = \mat{3&-5\\-1&2}$ is such a matrix.

				Using similar reasoning to the previous part, we know $Y$ must be
				a $2\times2$ matrix, so suppose $Y=\mat{a&b\\c&b}$ for some
				$a,b,c,d\in\R$.

				From the second part above, we know
				\[
					\mat{1\\0}_{\mathcal E} = \mat{3\\-1}_{\mathcal C}
					\quad \text{and} \quad

	Module 8, 9

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Identify the orientation of ordered bases in $\R^2$.
		\item Given a set of input and output vectors for a
			linear transformation $L:\R^2\to\R^2$, find
			a matrix for the transformation.
		\item Given a picture $X$ and its image under a linear transformation,
			find a matrix for the transformation.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	Orientation is a topic that comes up in physics and explains the sign
	of the determinant. We define orientation with an existential statement
	about whether or not certain homeomorphisms exist. The goal is not to
	prove anything rigorously about orientation, but to get students to
	make pictures for themselves of vectors moving.

	The idea is simple: $n-1$ vectors span a space that partitions $\R^n$ in
	two. Add a vector in the top partition (appropriately ordered) and you get
	a positive orientation; add to the bottom and you get a negative orientation.
	There's no way to get from one to the other without passing through the
	hyperplane. We focus on $\R^2$ so that the pictures are easy to draw.
	Eventually we will compute orientation from the determinant, but it's nice
	to have a grounding in where it comes from.

	While we're thinking dynamically, we can start thinking about transformation.
	We already know how to multiply a matrix and a vector and interpret it in
	two different ways. Now we will add a third: multiplication by a given
	matrix is a transformation from vectors to vectors.

	Most of our study of matrix transformations will be of transformations from $\R^n$
	to $\R^n$, even though non-square matrices can describe other transformations.
	For now we stick with pictures of $\R^2$ since they are easy to draw. Then
	we will generalize to linear transformations.

				\item Students might need some hints. Good starting hints are: ``Discuss
					what size the inputs and outputs to your matrix are and then what size
					the matrix must be.'' and ``If you're stuck, try making a matrix of variables
					and then figuring out what the variables are.''
				\item Many groups will miss the ``12''-point and ``16''-point designations, assuming that each
					grid line indicates one unit.
				\item Groups will pick different vectors: some will pick
					vectors rooted in the lower-left and others will pick vectors
					that go ``along'' the $N$. Have a discussion about how
					these relate via linear combinations and why you get the
					same matrix either way.
				\item Most groups will only deal with the ``corners'' of the $N$ and ignore
					the fact that the $N$ is made up of line segments. Using the language
					of convex linear combinations and linearity of matrix multiplication,
					we can come up with a proof that generalizes the corners to the whole $N$.

Suppose that the ``N'' on the left is written in regular 12-point font.  Find a matrix $A$ that will transform
	the ``N'' into the letter on the right which is written in an \emph{italic} 16-point font.

Work with your group to write out your solution and approach.  Make a list of any assumptions you
notice your group making or any questions for further pursuit.

	\Title{Linear Transformations I}

	\Heading{Textbook}
	Module 9

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use the fact that linear transformations take lines to lines and preserve
			ratios to classify transformations as linear or not.
		\item Use the formal definition of a linear transformation to prove whether or not a
			transformation is linear.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
		Linear transformations are one of the fundamental objects of study in linear algebra.
		It's time to see what they look like and what they can do.

		We want to develop both a visual and algebraic intuition for linear transformations.
		Visually, a linear transformation takes straight lines to straight lines and preserves ``ratios'' between
		vectors (making this statement precise is hard). Algebraically, linear transformations are exactly
		the functions that factor in and out of linear combinations, making them easy to work with.

		Though few things in our world are linear, calculus shows us how to approximate
		non-linear functions with linear ones. As a consequence, linear transformations show
		up all over the place, and so it's worth spending time to understand them.

\question
	Some council members were wondering how letters placed in other
	locations in the plane would be transformed under $A= \mat{ 1&  1/3  \\ 0 & 4/3}$.
	If other letters are placed around the
	``N,'' the students argued over four different possible results for the
	transformed letters. Which choice below, if any, is correct, and why? If none of
	the four options are correct, what would the correct option be, and why?

	Module 10

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Draw the image of a set under a (not necessarily linear) transformation.
		\item Recognize composition of functions as not commutative.
		\item Decompose complicated transformations in terms of simpler ones.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
		Linear transformations are a big topic, and we're continuing our study.

		We start by introducing the technical term \emph{image} so that we can describe
		a transformation changing a bunch of points at once. This term will be used again when
		we start looking at determinants, which measure how transformations change volumes.

		Linear transformations are nice because the composition of two linear transformations
		is another linear transformation. That means, given a complicated transformation, we can
		search for a sequence of simple transformations that will have the same effect. This is
		where many of the matrix decompositions (which we aren't covering in this course) come from.

		Geometrically, it's easier to reason about simple transformations in a sequence than a complicated
		transformation. Algebraically, we will be relying on composition of linear functions and its relationship
		to matrices when we decompose a matrix into a product of elementary matrices (which in turn will
		allow us to think about the determinant algebraically).

			be a line segment with endpoints $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ and let $A$ be
			a linear transformation. Must $A(\ell)$ be a line segment?
			What are its endpoints?
			\begin{solution}
				$A(\ell)$ must be a line segment, with endpoints $A(\vec a)$ and
				$A(\vec b)$.

				For any scalars $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$, by the linearity of $A$
				we have: $A(\alpha_1\vec a+\alpha_2\vec b)=\alpha_1A(\vec a)+\alpha_2A(\vec b)$.

				If $\alpha_1+\alpha_2=1$, then the linear combination on the right
				is also convex, and so $A(\ell)$ is the set of convex combinations
				of $A(\vec a)$ and $A(\vec b)$.
				This is precisely the straight line segment joining $A(\vec a)$
				and $A(\vec b)$.

				Note that if $A(\vec a)=A(\vec b)$ (for example, if $A$ is the
				zero transformation), then $A(\ell)$ will consist of the single
				point, which we think of as a ``degenerate'' line segment in this
				situation.

			\begin{solution}
				The task asked us to find a linear transformation such that the

				By the previous exercise, we now know it suffices to find a
				linear transformation that sends the four endpoints of line
				segments on the regular ``N'' to the corresponding four endpoints

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Recognize matrix multiplication as an operation related to function composition.
		\item Define \emph{range} and \emph{null space} for both a matrix and a transformation.
		\item Compute the range and null space of linear transformations described
			with a formula or geometrically.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
		We've studied composition of linear transformations in detail, and we have explored
		matrix transformations. Now it is time to see how the two relate. That is, given
		two matrix transformations, the matrix for their composition can be obtained by
		multiplying the matrices in the proper order.

		Every linear transformation has a range and a null space. The dimension of the range
		will give the rank of the transformation, and the dimension of the null space
		will tell how far a transformation is from being one-to-one. These two subspaces come up
		a lot when posing and solving problems, so we'd like to get some familiarity with them,
		both computationally
		and visually.

	\label{projectionAndRotation}
	Define $\mathcal P$ to be projection onto $\Span\Set{\vec u}$ where $\vec u=\mat{2\\3}$,
	and let $\mathcal R$ be rotation counter-clockwise by $90^\circ$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Find a matrix $P$ so that $P\vec x=\mathcal P(\vec x)$ for all $\vec x\in\R^2$.
			\begin{solution}
				$P = \frac{1}{13}\mat{4&6\\6&9}$ is such a matrix.

				The matrix $P$ corresponding to $\mathcal P$ is a $2\times 2$ matrix,
				so suppose $P=\mat{a&b\\c&d}$ for some $a,b,c,d\in\R$. Then we
				know that if $\Set{\xhat,\yhat}$ is the standard basis for $\R^2$,
				\[
					P(\xhat)=\mat{a\\c} \quad \text{and} \quad P(\yhat)=\mat{b\\d}.
				\]
				We know from an earlier exercise that
				$\mathcal P(\vec x)=\dfrac{\vec x\cdot\vec u}{\vec u\cdot\vec u}\vec u$.
				Therefore, the first column of $P$ is
				\[
					\mat{a\\c}=\mathcal P(\xhat)=\frac{2}{13}\vec u=\frac{1}{13}\mat{4\\6}
				\]
				and the second column of $P$ is
				\[
					\mat{b\\d}=\mathcal P(\yhat)=\frac{3}{13}\vec u=\frac{1}{13}\mat{6\\9}.
				\]
			\end{solution}
		\item Find a matrix $R$ so that $R\vec x=\mathcal R(\vec x)$ for all $\vec x\in\R^2$.
			\begin{solution}
				$R=\mat{0&-1\\1&0}$ is such a matrix.

				Using the same reasoning as the previous part, we can compute
				\[
					\mathcal R(\xhat)=\yhat=\mat{0\\1}
					\quad \text{and} \quad
					\mathcal R(\yhat)=-\xhat=\mat{-1\\0}.
				\]
				Therefore, the matrix $R$ for $\mathcal R$ is the matrix with the
				two vectors above as its respective columns.
			\end{solution}
		\item Write down matrices $A$ and $B$ for $\mathcal P\circ\mathcal R$
			and $\mathcal R\circ \mathcal P$.
			\begin{solution}
				$A=\frac{1}{13}\mat{6&-4\\9&-6}$ and $B=\frac{1}{13}\mat{-6&-9\\4&6}$
				are two such matrices.

				Using the same reasoning as above, we can compute
				\[
					(\mathcal P\circ\mathcal R)(\xhat)
					=\mathcal P(\mathcal R(\xhat))
					=\mathcal P(\yhat)
					=\frac{1}{13}\mat{6\\9}
					\qquad \text{and} \qquad
					(\mathcal P\circ\mathcal R)(\yhat)
					=\mathcal P(\mathcal R(\yhat))
					=\mathcal P(-\xhat)
					=\frac{1}{13}\mat{-4\\-6}.
				\]
				Therefore, the matrix $A$ for $\mathcal P\circ\mathcal R$ is the
				matrix with the two vectors above as its respective columns.

				Similarly, for $\mathcal R\circ \mathcal P$, we can compute:
				\begin{gather*}
					(\mathcal R\circ\mathcal P)(\xhat)
					=\mathcal R(\mathcal P(\xhat))
					=\mathcal R\left(\frac{1}{13}\mat{4\\6}\right)
					=\frac{1}{13}\mat{-6\\4} \\
					(\mathcal R\circ\mathcal P)(\yhat)
					=\mathcal R(\mathcal P(\yhat))
					=\mathcal R\left(\frac{1}{13}\mat{6\\9}\right)
					=\frac{1}{13}\mat{-9\\6}.
				\end{gather*}
				Therefore, the matrix $B$ for $\mathcal R\circ\mathcal P$ is the
				matrix with these two vectors as its respective columns.
			\end{solution}
		\item How do the matrices $A$ and $B$ relate to the matrices $P$ and $R$?
			\begin{solution}
				$A = PR$ and $B = RP$.

				We can compute these matrix products to see this, but
				from the previous parts, we know that for any vector $\vec x$
				\[
					A\vec x
					=(\mathcal P\circ\mathcal R)(\vec x)
					=\mathcal P(\mathcal R(\vec x))
					=\mathcal P(R\vec x)
					=PR\vec x
				\]
				and
				\[
					B\vec x
					=(\mathcal R\circ\mathcal P)(\vec x)
					=\mathcal R(\mathcal P(\vec x)
					=\mathcal R(P\vec x)
					=RP\vec x.
				\]
				Using $\vec x = \xhat$ shows that first column of $A$ must equal
				the first column of $PR$, and using $\vec x = \yhat$ shows that
				the second column of $A$ must equal the second column of $PR$,
				and therefore $A = PR$. For the same reason, we must also have $B=RP$.

	$\vec u=\mat{2\\3}$ (like before).
	\begin{parts}
		\item What is the range of $\mathcal P$?
			\begin{solution}
				$\Range(\mathcal P)=\Span\Set{\vec u}$.

				$\mathcal P(\vec x)$ is by definition the vector in $\Span\Set{\vec u}$

				\end{enumerate}
			\end{solution}
		\item Show that the range of $T$ is a subspace.
			\begin{solution}
				Since $\Range(T)=T(\R^n)$ and $\R^n$ is non-empty, we know that $\Range(T)$ is non-empty.
				Therefore, to show that $\Range(T)$ is a subspace, we need to show (i) that it's closed under vector addition,
				and (ii) that it is closed under scalar multiplication.
				\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
					\item Let $\vec x,\vec y\in\Range(T)$.
						By definition, there exist $\vec u,\vec v\in\R^n$ such that $T(\vec u)=\vec x$
						and $T(\vec v)=\vec y$. Since $T$ is linear,
						$
							\vec x+\vec y=T(\vec u)+T(\vec v)=T(\vec u+\vec v),
						$
						and so $\vec x+\vec y\in\Range(T)$.
					\item Let $\vec x\in\Range(T)$ and let $\alpha$ be a scalar.
						By definition, there exists $\vec u\in\R^n$ such that $T(\vec u)=\vec x$,

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Recognize a matrix as the representation of a linear transformation in a basis.
		\item Distinguish between matrices and linear transformations.
		\item Compute the fundamental subspaces of a matrix and relate them to the range and null space
			of the corresponding linear transformation.
		\item Identify which subspaces of a matrix are changed when row operations are performed.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
		Just like column vectors were really a shorthand for describing linear combinations
		of standard basis vectors,
		matrices are a shorthand for describing linear transformations. Most of the time we play fast
		and loose with notation and treat matrices as linear transformations. However there are times,
		like when talking about change of basis, when it is important to distinguish between
		a transformation and its representation. In preparation for this, we are going to spend some
		time studying the relationship between linear transformations and matrices.

		Once we find a matrix for a linear transformation, we have a natural set of row vectors and column
		vectors (coming from the matrix). These span the row space and the column space,
		and together with the null space give the fundamental subspaces of a matrix. The column space of
		a matrix corresponds to the range of a transformation and the null space of a matrix corresponds
		to the null space of a transformation. The row space is the odd one out, but is included since it is
		the orthogonal complement to the null space (which will allow us to tie together normal form and vector
		form of planes through the origin).

		In this setting, we also start studying row reduction as a ``transformation''. It changes
		the column space but not the null space. When we study elementary matrices and inverses, we will
		see row reduction in terms of matrix multiplication.

					This problem forces the use of precise language and terminology (e.g., that of 
					change of basis) to discuss a matrix and its induced transformation.
				\item Throughout most of the course, we are sloppy in distinguishing $\mat{1\\2}$ and
					$\mat{1\\2}_{\mathcal E}$. This allows us to write $T\left(\mat{1\\2}\right)$ when $T:\R^2\to\R^2$

					Acknowledge this---we will continue to be sloppy some times, but when push comes to

	Let $M$ be a $2\times 2$ matrix and let $\vec v\in\R^2$. Further, let $T_M$
	be the transformation induced by $M$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item What is the difference between
			``$M\vec v$'' and ``$M[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}$''?
			\begin{solution}
				``$M\vec v$'' is ambiguous notation, as it is only defined if
				$\vec v$ is a specific column vector. There are infinitely many
				different bases of $\R^2$, and so a given vector $\vec v$ has
				infinitely many different representations as a column vector,
				each in a different basis.

				``$M[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}$'' is unambiguous, as
				$[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}$ is an explicit representation of $\vec v$
				in a particular basis.
			\end{solution}
		\item What is $[T_M\xhat]_{\mathcal E}$?
			\begin{solution}
				It is the first column of $M$.

				By definition,
				$[T_M\xhat]_{\mathcal E}=M[\xhat]_{\mathcal E}=M\mat{1\\0}$,
				which equals the first column of $M$.
			\end{solution}
		\item \label{inducedTransform.3}
			Can you relate the columns of $M$ to the range of $T_M$?
			\begin{solution}
				The range of $T_M$ equals the span of the columns of $M$.

				By the previous part, the first column of $M$ is in the range of
				$T_M$. By a similar argument, the second column of $M$ is also
				in the range of $T_M$, since it equals $[T_M\yhat]_{\mathcal E}$.
				Therefore the span of the columns of $M$ is a subset of the range
				of $T_M$.

				On the other hand, if $\vec v_1=\mat{a\\c}$ and $\vec v_2=\mat{b\\d}$
				are the columns of $M$ and $\vec x = \alpha_1\vec v_1+\alpha_2\vec v_2$
				is an element of $\Span\Set*{\vec v_1,\vec v_2}$, then
				\[
					[\vec x]_{\mathcal E}
					=\alpha_1\mat{a\\c}+\alpha_2\mat{b\\d}
					=\alpha_1[T_M\xhat]_{\mathcal E}+\alpha_2[T_M\yhat]_{\mathcal E}
					=[T_M(\alpha_1\xhat+\alpha_2\yhat)]_{\mathcal E}.
				\]
				Therefore $\vec x$ is in the range of $T_M$.

			\end{solution}
		\item Is the row space of $A$ the same as the column space of $A$?
			\begin{solution}
				No.

				Although they are both two dimensional spaces, $\Row(A)$ is a
				subspace of $\R^3$ and all vectors in it have three coordinates
				(with the third always being zero), while $\Col(A)$ is a
				subspace of $\R^2$ and all vectors in it have two coordinates.
				Therefore, these two spaces are different.

		\item Describe the set of all vectors orthogonal to the rows of $A$.
			\begin{solution}
				The $z$-axis in $\R^3$.

				A vector $\vec x=\mat{x\\y\\z}$ is orthogonal to the rows of $A$
				if and only if its dot product with both rows is zero. That is
				\[
					\vec x\cdot\mat{1\\0\\0} = x = 0
					\quad \text{and} \quad
					\vec x\cdot\mat{0\\1\\0} = y = 0.

				A vector $\vec x=\mat{x\\y\\z}$ is in $\Null(A)$ if
				and only if
				\[
					A\vec x = \mat{x\\y} = \vec 0.
				\]
				These are the same conditions as in the previous part, so the set

		\item Describe the range and null space of $T_A$, the transformation
			induced by $A$.
			\label{fundamentalSubspaces.6}
			\begin{solution}
				$\Range(T_A)=\Col(A)=\R^2$ and $\Null(T_A)=\Null(A)$,
				which is the $z$-axis in $\R^3$.

				By Problem \ref{inducedTransform}.\ref{inducedTransform.3}, the
				range of an induced transformation equals the span of the columns
				of the matrix. In other words, $\Range(T_A)=\Col(A)$.

				Next, by definition $\vec v\in\Null(T_A)$ when
				$[T_A\vec v]_{\mathcal E}=A[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}=\vec 0$.
				In other words, $\vec v\in\Null(T_A)$ if and only if
				$[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}\in\Null(A)$. We know from the previous

				Row operations replace rows with linear combinations of rows.

	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Students will gravitate towards rank for matrices because it's definition
					is ``easier''. Further, the book emphasizes this definition more. However,
					when viewed as a fact about transformations, it won't matter which
					basis you write down a transformation in. For this reason, we study the
					rank of a transformation directly.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}
	Rank is a number that tells us a lot about a linear transformation or a matrix. In particular,
	if a linear transformation $T$ is full rank, we know it is one-to-one and onto and that there are unique
	solutions to $T(\vec x)=\vec b$. In contrast, if the rank is not full, we know the transformation either fails to be
	one-to-one or fails to be onto. By considering the domain of $T$, we can decide which property fails.

	The language of rank will help us reason about dimension, and for us the main application will be the
	rank-nullity theorem. We will not use the ideas of rank to their full potential, but in
	future courses, students will hear the term ``rank'' thrown around a lot.

	Let $\mathcal P$ be projection onto $\Span\Set{\vec u}$ where $\vec u=\mat{2\\3}$,
	and let $\mathcal R$ be rotation counter-clockwise by $90^\circ$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Describe $\Range(\mathcal P)$ and $\Range(\mathcal R)$.
			\begin{solution}
				$\Range(\mathcal P)=\Span\Set{\vec u}$, and $\Range(\mathcal R)=\R^2$.

				For $\mathcal P$, by the definition of projection $\mathcal P(\vec x)$
				is the vector in $\Span\Set{\vec u}$ that is closest to $\vec x$,
				so in particular $\mathcal P(\vec x) \in \Span\Set{\vec u}$ for
				all $\vec x\in\R^2$. Therefore $\Range(\mathcal P)\subseteq\Span\Set{\vec u}$.

				On the other hand, $\mathcal P(\alpha \vec u)=\alpha\mathcal P(\vec u)=\alpha\vec u$
				for any scalar $\alpha$, and so $\Range(\mathcal P)=\Span\Set{\vec u}$.

				For $\mathcal Q$, we have that any vector $\vec x\in\R^2$,
				$\vec x=\mathcal Q(\vec y)$, where $\vec y$ is the rotation of
				$\vec x$ clockwise by $90^\circ$. Therefore $\Range(\mathcal Q)=\R^2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item What is the rank of $\mathcal P$ and the rank of $\mathcal R$?
			\begin{solution}
				$\Rank(\mathcal P)=1$ and $\Rank(\mathcal R)=2$.

				By the previous part, we know $\Range(\mathcal P)$ is 1-dimensional
				and $\Range(\mathcal Q)$ is 2-dimensional.

			$\mathcal R$. What is the rank of $P$ and the rank of $R$?
			\begin{solution}
				$\Rank(P)=1$ and $\Rank(R)=2$.

				By Problem \ref{projectionAndRotation}, $P=\frac{1}{13}\mat{4&6\\6&9}$
				and $R=\mat{0&-1\\1&0}$ are the	matrices corresponding to
				$\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal R$. Then we compute:
				\[
					\rref(P)=\mat{1&\frac{3}{2}\\0&0}
					\quad \text{and} \quad
					\rref(R)=\mat{1&0\\0&1}.
				\]
				These matrices have 1 and 2 pivots, respectively.

		\item Make a conjecture about how the rank of a transformation and the
			rank of its corresponding matrix relate. Can you justify your claim?
			\label{rankOfMatricesAndTransformations.4}
			\begin{solution}
				They are equal.

				By Problem \ref{inducedTransform}.\ref{inducedTransform.3}, the
				range of a transformation is equal to the column space of its
				corresponding matrix, and therefore the dimensions of these two
				spaces are equal. In other words, the rank of a transformation is
				equal to the dimension of the column space of its corresponding
				matrix.

				We already know that the dimension of the column space of a matrix
				is equal to the number of pivots in its reduced row echelon form,

	The rank-nullity theorem is our big application of rank. It states that whatever
	left-over dimensions of the domain are not accounted for by the rank end up in the null space.
	This is valuable to know because a matrix equation $A\vec x=\vec b$ has infinitely many
	solutions if and only if $A\vec x=\vec b$ is consistent and $A$ has a non-trivial null space. Using
	the rank-nullity theorem, we can connect the rank of a matrix to whether a matrix equation has infinitely
	many solutions. And, pulling this back into the world of transformations, we can start reasoning
	about the number of solutions to an abstract equation $T(\vec x)=\vec b$ where $T$ is a linear
	transformation.

	We also start talking about inverses. Invertible transformations always have full rank, but
	our goal here is to start thinking about transformations that ``undo'' other transformations. We
	are building up to things like an intuitive understanding of $(T\circ S)^{-1} = S^{-1}\circ T^{-1}$.

Pat and Jamie explained their approach to the Italicizing N task as follows:
\begin{quote}\itshape
	In order to find the matrix $A$, we are going to find a matrix that makes the ``N'' taller,

		\item Define the \emph{inverse} of a matrix.
		\item Define an \emph{elementary matrix}.

	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	A common mathematical technique is to decompose a complicated problem into lots of simpler ones.
	In this lesson, the complicated problem is that of finding the inverse of a matrix. We will do this
	by recasting row reduction in terms of elementary matrices and using the rules of matrix arithmetic
	to produce the inverse of a matrix. This is not the most efficient way to produce the inverse, but we
	do it this way for three reasons:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Elementary matrices bring row reduction out of the realm of ``algorithms on entries'' and into
			the realm of matrices and function composition.
		\item Decomposition into elementary matrices foreshadows further matrix decompositions (like $LU$ or $QR$, etc.),
			even though we won't be working with those decompositions in this course.
		\item Decomposition into elementary matrices will be used to compute general determinants.
	\end{enumerate}


	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Most students won't know the definition of the inverse of a function.
					They think of the inverse of a function in terms of ``the reflection of the graph
					across $y=x$''. This is a big problem for us.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{notes}

	As far as inverses are concerned, they will allow us to recast solutions to systems of equations as ``inverse problems''.

				$E_1A$ is the result applying the row operation $R_3\mapsto R_3+2R_1$
				to $A$, and similarly $E_2A$ is the result of applying the row
				operation $R_3\mapsto R_3-2R_1$ to $A$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Without computing, what should the result of applying the row
		operation $R_3\mapsto R_3-2R_1$ to $E_1$ be? Compute and verify.
			\begin{solution}
				It should be the identity matrix, since the row operation
				$R_3\mapsto R_3-2R_1$ should undo the operation $R_3\mapsto R_3+2R_1$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Without computing, what should $E_2E_1$ be? What about $E_1E_2$?
		Now compute and verify.
			\begin{solution}
				They should both be the identity matrix.

				The solution to part 3 above lead us to believe that applying $E_1$
				to a matrix has the effect of applying the row operation $R_3\mapsto R_3+2R_1$
				to it. Applying that row operation to $E_2$ would produce the
				identity matrix, so we expect that $E_1E_2$ should equal the
				identity matrix.

				Similar reasoning leads us to believe that $E_2E_1$ should also
				equal the identity matrix.

				Indeed, we can compute
				\[
					E_1E_2
					=\mat{1&0&0\\0&1&0\\2&0&1}\mat{1&0&0\\0&1&0\\-2&0&1}
					=\mat{1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1}

					=E_2E_1.

	Inverses give a new way to solve systems of equations. Using row reduction, solving $A\vec x=\vec b_i$ for $i=1,\ldots, 7$

				We know that the reduced row echelon form of $C$ must be of the

				row operations that reduces $A$ to $\rref(A)=I$. So the same sequence

				The system has one solution: $\vec x=A^{-1}\vec b=\mat{-9\\6\\2}$.

				We can read this solution from the reduced row echelon form of the

				both sides of the equation on the left by $A^{-1}$:

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Create and use change-of-basis matrices.
		\item Describe in words what a change-of-basis matrix and its inverse does.
		\item Given a linear transformation, explain how to get from a matrix representation in a basis $\mathcal A$
			to a matrix representation in a basis $\mathcal B$.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	Change of basis is one of \emph{the} big ideas in linear algebra. The universe has no
	privileged basis. Some bases are nicer than others, they may be orthonormal, for example, but
	other than that, all bases are created equal. Therefore, we must understand the relationship 
	\emph{between} bases. We need facility in converting from one basis to another. And, lo and behold,
	converting between representations in a basis is a linear transformation!

	Just as coordinates represent vectors with respect to a basis, matrices represent
	linear transformations with respect to a basis. And, just as the same vector can
	have two different representations in terms of coordinates, the same transformation
	can have different representations in terms of a basis. If two matrices represent the
	same transformation, we call them \emph{similar}. The question of ``given two
	matrices, how can you tell if they're similar?'' is answered in the next course, MAT224, with
	the study of Jordan forms.

				There are two methods to determine this.

					=-5\mat{4\\2}+2\mat{5\\3}
					=\mat{-10\\-4}.
				\]
				These two vectors are the respective columns of $[T]_{\mathcal E}$,
				as usual.

				Method 2:
				Since $A$ changes vectors from the $\mathcal C$ basis to the standard
				basis and $A^{-1}$ changes vectors from the standard basis to the

	Determinants are geometric and combinatoric objects. We leave the combinatoric perspective for another
	course and focus only on the geometric perspective. We do this because:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Seeing determinants as change of volumes explains the use of the Jacobian in multivariable calculus.
		\item Determinants of linear transformations, by definition, don't depend on a choice of basis.
		\item The product rule for determinants is a consequence of composition of functions.
		\item $\det(T) = 0$ $\implies$ $T$ is not invertible has a straightforward explanation: If the volume
			becomes zero, a dimension was ``crushed'' and therefore $T$ has a non-trivial null space.
	\end{enumerate}
	The disadvantage of the purely geometric approach is that $\det(A)=\det(A^T)$ becomes a mysterious theorem
	(though this can be explained with elementary matrices).

	Determinants, especially higher-dimensional ones, are difficult to compute from the definition. However,
	since $\det(A\circ B)=\det(A)\det(B)$, we can compute the determinant of complicated transformations/matrices
	by decomposing them into simple ones.

	Elementary matrices come in three types, one for each type of elementary operation. Two of the elementary
	matrices change the determinant by a multiplicative factor, and the last one (the workhorse of row reduction) doesn't
	change the determinant at all. Given a decomposition of a matrix as the product of elementary matrices,
	it is easy to compute the determinant. However, if we just want to compute the determinant, it's easier than that.
	By row reducing while keeping track of row swaps and when
	we normalize rows, we can efficiently compute the determinant of any matrix.

	Elementary matrices also nail down two theorems:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[(1)] $\det(A) = 0$ $\iff$ $A$ is not invertible.
		\item[(2)] $\det(A)=\det(A^T)$.
	\end{enumerate}

	The first theorem is proved because, for a matrix $A$, we have $A=X\!\Rref(A)$ where $X$ is the product of elementary matrices.
	If $\Rref(A)\neq I$, the matrix cannot be invertible and $\det(A)=0$. If $\Rref(A)=I$, then $\det(A)\neq 0$.

	The second theorem follows by noticing that if $E$ is an elementary matrix, $E^T$ is an elementary matrix 
	of the same type and it changes volume by the same amount. Thus, by decomposing $A$ as a product of elementary
	matrices (assume it is invertible), we see $\det(A)=\det(A^T)$.

			\begin{solution}
				Yes. The oriented volume of $T(R_2)=\tfrac{1}{2}$ and the oriented volume of $T(R+\Set{\vec e_2})=2$.
				
				We don't have enough information to determine what $T(R_2)$ looks like, but we do know (i) $T(R_2)$ 
				will be a parallelogram, (ii) $T(R)$ has oriented volume $2$, and (iii) $T(R)$ is made of
				four translated copies of $T(R_2)$. From this we deduce that the oriented volume of $T(R_2)=\tfrac{1}{4}\big($oriented
				volume of $T(R)\big)=(\tfrac{1}{4})(2)$.

				To find the oriented volume of $T(R+\Set{\yhat})$, we use linearity to observe
				\[
					T(R+\Set{\yhat})=T(R)+T(\Set{\yhat}) = T(R)+\Set{T\yhat}.

				$S\circ T(R)=S(T(R))$. We already know $T(R)$ has a volume
				of $2$, and so $S(T(R))$ has a volume of $6$, since $S$ scales
				the volumes of all regions by $3$. The oriented volume of $S\circ T(R)$

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define eigenvector/value.
		\item Compute eigenvectors/values given a geometric description of a linear transformation.
		\item Argue that $A-\lambda I$ has a non-trivial null space $\iff$ $\lambda$ is an eigenvector for $A$.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	We want students to be able to explain how the procedure for finding eigenvectors/values
	relates to the definition of eigenvectors/values. Therefore, we proceed slowly, exploring
	properties of eigenvectors/values one step at a time.

	As we've already seen, if $\vec v$ is an eigenvector for $A$, then $A\vec v$ is easy to compute.
	It's less obvious to students that $(A+tI)\vec v$ is equally easy to compute. 
	The algorithm for
	finding eigenvectors/values relies on (i) our ability to compute the null space of $A-\lambda I$,
	and (ii) our ability to algorithmically determine if $A-\lambda I$ is invertible. In this lesson we
	establish both needs, but don't yet practice an algorithm.

	We are building up to diagonalization. One of the tools along the way is the characteristic polynomial,
	which connects algebra (in particular the fundamental theorem of algebra) to matrices. It is a deep
	and mysterious connection and is not technically needed to study eigenvalues and eigenvectors\footnote{
		For example, see \emph{Linear Algebra Done Right}'s approach.}, but characteristic polynomials
	are used in many fields and provide a quick way to find eigenvalues.

	We are not studying characteristic polynomials outright. Instead, they are a clever object
	that allows us to determine when a matrix $A-\lambda I$ has a non-trivial null space. (Alas, the
	study of minimal polynomials must wait for a different course.)

	Suppose $\chr(E)=-\lambda(2-\lambda)(-3-\lambda)$ for some unknown $3\times 3$
	matrix $E$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item What are the eigenvalues of $E$?
			\begin{solution}
				$0$, $2$, and $-3$. 

				The eigenvalues of $E$ are the roots of $\chr(E)$. 
			\end{solution}
		\item Is $E$ invertible?
			\begin{solution}
				No. 

				Since $0$ is an eigenvalue of $E$, there must be a non-zero vector
				$\vec v$ such that $E\vec v=0\vec v=\vec 0$. This means $\Nullity(E)>0$,
				which implies $E$ is not invertible. 
			\end{solution}
		\item What can you say about $\Nullity(E)$, $\Nullity(E-3I)$, $\Nullity(E+3I)$?
			\begin{solution}
				$\Nullity(E)=1$, $\Nullity(E-3I)=0$, $\Nullity(E+3I)=1$

				Notice that evaluating the characteristic polynomial at $\lambda$
				give the determinant of $E-\lambda I$. From this, we can determine the
				invertibility of any matrix of the form $E-\lambda I$.

				Since $E$ is not invertible, $\Nullity(E)\geq 1$. Since $E-3I$ is
				invertible, $\Nullity(E-3I)=0$, and since $E+3I$ is not invertible,
				$\Nullity(E+3I)\geq 1$.

				To pin down the nullities of $E$ and $E+3I$ exactly takes more work.
				$E$ has three distinct eigenvalues and so $E$ must have three linearly
				independent eigenvectors $\vec v_0,\vec v_2,\vec v_{-3}$. Further, $\Span\Set{\vec v_i}\subseteq 
				\Null(E-\lambda_i I)$.				
				Since $\vec v_0,\vec v_1,\vec v_{-3}\in\R^3$, it must be the case that $\Null(E-\lambda_i I)$ is one

	The matrix $P^{-1}$ takes vectors in the standard basis and outputs
	vectors in their $\mathcal V$-basis representation. Here, $A$, $T_A$, and $\mathcal V$
	come from Problem \ref{actingOnEigenvectors}.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Describe in words what $P$ does.
			\begin{solution}
				$P$ undoes what $P^{-1}$ does, which is to say that it takes vectors
				in the $\mathcal V$ basis and outputs vectors in their representation
				in the standard basis.
			\end{solution}
		\item Describe how you can use $P$ and $P^{-1}$ to compute
			$T_A\vec y$ for any $\vec y\in \R^3$.
			\begin{solution}
				Computing $[T_A]_{\mathcal V}[\vec y]_{\mathcal V}$ is easy, since
				$[T_A]_{\mathcal V}$ just multiplies each coordinate of $[\vec y]_{\mathcal V}$
				by a scalar. We know that $P^{-1}[\vec y]_{\mathcal E}=[\vec y]_{\mathcal V}$ 
				and that $P[\vec x]_{\mathcal V}=[\vec x]_{\mathcal E}$ and so 
				given any vector $\vec v$ represented by $[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}$
				in the standard basis, we have
				\[
					A[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}=P[T_A]_{\mathcal V}P^{-1}[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}
				\]
				since
				\[
					P[T_A]_{\mathcal V}P^{-1}[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}
					=P[T_A]_{\mathcal V}[\vec v]_{\mathcal V}
					=P[T_A\vec v]_{\mathcal V}
					=[T_A\vec v]_{\mathcal E}
					=A[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}.

			\[
				PDP^{-1}=A?
			\]
			\begin{solution}
				$D=\mat{2&0&0\\0&-1&0\\0&0&1}$.

				$D=[A]_{\mathcal V}$, so by the previous part we have that
				that for any vector $\vec v$
				\[
					A[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}=PDP^{-1}[\vec v]_{\mathcal E}.
				\]
			\end{solution}
		\item $[\vec x]_{\mathcal V}=\mat{1\\3\\4}$.  Compute $T_A^{100}\vec x$. Express
			your answer in both the $\mathcal V$ basis and the standard basis.
			\begin{solution}
				$T_A^{100}\vec x=\mat{2^{100}\\3\\4}_{\mathcal V}$.

				By the previous problem, we know how $T_A$ acts on vectors represented
				in the $\mathcal V$ basis: it multiplies the first coordinate by
				$2$, the second by $-1$, and leaves the third coordinate unchanged.
				So we compute
				\[
					T_A^{100}\mat{1\\3\\4}
					=T_A^{99}\mat{2\\-3\\4}
					=TA^{98}\mat{2^2\\3\\4}
					=T_A^{97}\mat{2^3\\-3\\4}
					=\dots
				\]
				To express $T_A^{100}\vec x$ in the standard basis, we use $P$.
				\[
					[T_A^{100}\vec x]_{\mathcal E} = P[T_A^{100}\vec x]_{\mathcal V} = \mat{2^{100}-1\\2^{100}+7\\2^{100}-6}.

	Let $B$ be an $n\times n$ matrix and let $T_B$ be the induced transformation.
	Suppose $T_B$ has eigenvectors $\vec v_1,\ldots, \vec v_n$ which
	form a basis for $\R^n$, and let $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$ be the corresponding
	eigenvalues.


	\begin{parts}
		\item How do the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $B$ and $T_B$ relate?
		\begin{solution}
			The eigenvalues of $B$ and $T_B$ are the same. The eigen vectors
			are also the same, except eigenvectors for $B$ must be written
			in the standard basis. E.g., $[\vec v_1]_{\mathcal E},\ldots,[\vec v_n]_{\mathcal E}$
			are eigenvectors for $B$.
		\end{solution}
		\item Is $B$ diagonalizable (i.e., similar to a diagonal matrix)?  If so, explain how to obtain its diagonalized form.
		\begin{solution}
			Yes. 

			$\mathcal V=\Set{\vec v_1,\ldots \vec v_n}$ is a basis consisting
			of eigenvectors for $T_B$. By definition, $B[\vec v_i]_{\mathcal E}=\lambda_i[\vec v_i]_{\mathcal E}$
			for each $i$. 

			Let $P$ be the matrix that takes vectors represented in the
			$\mathcal V$ basis and outputs their representations in the standard
			basis $\mathcal E$. Then, for example, we should have that
			\[
				P^{-1}BP\matc{1\\0\\\vdots\\0}
				=P^{-1}BP[\vec v_1]_{\mathcal V}
				=P^{-1}B[\vec v_1]_{\mathcal E}
				=\lambda_1P^{-1}[\vec v_1]_{\mathcal E}
				=\lambda_1[\vec v_1]_{\mathcal V}
				=\matc{\lambda_1\\0\\\vdots\\0}.
			\]
			Therefore, the first column of $P^{-1}BP$ is $\matc{\lambda_1\\0\\\vdots\\0}$.
			By similar reasoning, the $i^\text{th}$ column of $P^{-1}BP$ consists
			of all zeroes except for $\lambda_i$ in the $i^\text{th}$ position. 
			In other words, $B$ is similar to the diagonal matrix $D$ with 
			$\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_n$ along the diagonal, in that
			order. 
		\end{solution}
		\item What if one of the eigenvalues of $T_B$ is zero?  Would $B$ be diagonalizable?
			\begin{solution}
				Yes. 

				The argument in the previous part does not depend on any of the
				eigenvalues being non-zero.
			\end{solution}
		\item What if the eigenvectors of $T_B$ did not form a basis for $\R^n$.
			Would $B$ be diagonalizable?
			\begin{solution}
				No. 

				The argument we used in the first part definitely would not work.

				Consider the converse, and assume $B$ is similar to diagonal 
				matrix $D$. That is, suppose there is an invertible matrix 
				$P$ such that $B=PDP^{-1}$. Then, if $\vec v_1$ is the first 
				column of $P$ and $\lambda_1$ is the first entry on	the diagonal
				of $D$, we would have
				\[
					B[\vec v_1]_{\mathcal E}
					=PDP^{-1}[\vec v_1]_{\mathcal E}
					=PD[\vec v_1]_{\mathcal V}
					=PD\matc{1\\0\\\vdots\\0}
					=\lambda_1P\matc{1\\0\\\vdots\\0}
					=\lambda_1[\vec v_1]_{\mathcal E},
				\]
				meaning that $[\vec v_1]_{\mathcal E}$ is an eigenvector of $B$. Similarly, all
				of the columns of $P$ would be eigenvectors of $B$, with eigenvalues
				equal to the corresponding entry on the diagonal of $D$. Since $P$ is 
				invertible, its columns must be linearly independent, and therefore
				the $n$ columns of $P$ would form a basis of $\R^n$ consisting of
				eigenvectors of $B$.

	Diagonalization is great, but not all matrices can be diagonalized. This is because the transformation might not
	have a basis of eigenvectors. The sum of the geometric multiplicities gives the dimension of the span
	of all the eigenvectors. If it is not $n$ (for an $n\times n$ matrix), the transformation cannot be diagonalizable.

	\begin{parts}
		\item Is $F$ diagonalizable?  Why or why not?
			\begin{solution}
				No.

				$F$ is diagonalizable if and only if there is a basis of $\R^2$
				consisting of eigenvectors of $F$, so we begin by computing all
				eigenvectors of $F$.
				$\chr(F)=(3-\lambda)^2$, so the only eigenvalue of $F$ is $3$, 
				meaning that the eigenvectors of $F$ are precisely the non-zero
				vectors in $\Null(F-3I)$. We check that 
				\[
					\Null(F-3I)
					=\Null\left(\mat{0&1\\0&0}\right)
					=\Span\Set*{\mat{1\\0}},
				\]
				which is one-dimensional, and so there cannot be a basis of $\R^2$
				consisting of eigenvectors of $F$. 
			\end{solution}
		\item Is $G$ diagonalizable?  Why or why not?
			\begin{solution}
				Yes. $G$ is already diagonal (and is necessarily similar to itself).
			\end{solution}
		\item What are the geometric and algebraic multiplicities of each eigenvalue
			of $F$? What about the multiplicities for each eigenvalue of $G$?
			\begin{solution}
				The only eigenvalue for $F$ is $3$. Its geometric multiplicity is $1$, 
				and its algebraic multiplicity is $2$. 
				
				The only eigenvalue for $G$ is $3$. Its geometric and algebraic multiplicity is $2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Suppose $A$ is a matrix where the geometric multiplicity of one of its eigenvalues
			is smaller than the algebraic multiplicity of the same eigenvalue.  Is
			$A$ diagonalizable?  What if all the geometric and algebraic multiplicities
			match?
		\begin{solution}
				If one of the geometric multiplicities is smaller than the corresponding
				algebraic multiplicity, $A$ cannot be diagonalizable. 
				
				Since the characteristic polynomial of an $n\times n$ matrix has degree $n$,
				it has at most $n$ real roots. Since each root is an eigenvalue, we have
				\[
					\sum \text{ algebraic multiplicities }\leq n.
				\]
				If one of the geometric multiplicities is smaller than the algebraic multiplicities,
				we have
				\[
					\sum \text{ geometric multiplicities } < n,
				\]
				and so there cannot be a basis for $\R^n$ consisting of eigenvectors.

				For the converse statement, we need the fundamental theorem of algebra:\emph{
					a degree $n$ polynomial has exactly $n$ complex roots, counting multiplicity.}

				If we allow eigenvalues to be complex numbers, then
				\[
					\sum \text{ algebraic multiplicities }= n,
				\]
				and so if all geometric and algebraic multiplicities are equal, we have
				\[
					\sum \text{ geometric multiplicities } = n.
				\]
				Thus, there would be a basis of eigenvectors.
