                                <em><strong>Linear Algebra</strong></em>
                                is a free, open source textbook aimed at a first
                                or second year one-semester introductory linear
                                algebra course. The book is designed for a
                                non-proofs-focused course, but could be used in
                                a course that focuses on proofs.

                                of Toronto, student-facing (in-class) questions
                                are a main feature of <em>Linear Algebra</em>,
                                and the textbook doubles as a workbook with
                                space for students to write their solutions to
                                questions. It is designed to be used in classes

                            <p>
                                This book is your introductory guide to linear
                                algebra. It is divided into modules, and each
                                module is further divided into exposition,
                                practice problems, and core exercises.
                            </p>

                                To optimally learn from this text, you should:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Start each module by reading through the
                                    exposition to get familiar with the main
                                    ideas and linear algebra terminology.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Work through the core exercises to develop
                                    an understanding and intuition behind the
                                    main ideas and their subtleties.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Re-read the exposition and identify which
                                    concepts each core exercise connects with.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Work through the practice problems. These
                                    will serve as a check on whether you've
                                    understood the main ideas well enough to
                                    apply them.
                                </li>

                                <strong>The core exercises.</strong> Most (but
                                not all) core exercises will be worked through
                                during lecture time, and there is space for you
                                to work provided after each of the core
                                exercises. The point of the core exercises is to
                                develop the main ideas of linear algebra by
                                exploring examples.

                                <strong>So many definitions.</strong> A big part
                                of linear algebra is learning precise and
                                technical language. There are many terms and
                                definitions you need to learn, and by far the
                                best way to successfully learn these terms is to
                                understand where they come from, why they're
                                needed, and practice using them.

                                This book was designed for a one-semester
                                introductory linear algebra course course with a
                                focus on geometry (MAT223 at the University of
                                Toronto). It has not been designed for an “intro
                                to proofs”-style course, but could be adapted
                                for one.
                            </p>

                                Unlike a traditional textbook that is grouped
                                into chapters and sections by subject, this book
                                is grouped into modules. Each module contains
                                exposition about a subject, practice problems
                                (for students to work on by themselves), and
                                core exercises (for students to work on with
                                your guidance). Modules group related concepts,
                                but the modules have been designed to facilitate
                                learning linear algebra rather than to serve as
                                a reference. For example, information about
                                change-of-basis is spread across several
                                non-consecutive modules; each time
                                change-of-basis is readdressed, more detail is
                                added.

                            <p>A typical class day looks like:</p>

                                        Before class, students will read through
                                        the relevant module.

                                        broader context for the day’s topics, or
                                        answering questions.

                                        Students work individually or in
                                        pairs/small groups on the prescribed
                                        core exercise. During this time the
                                        instructor moves around the room
                                        addressing questions that students may
                                        have and giving one-on-one coaching.

                                        When most students have successfully
                                        solved the problem, the instructor
                                        refocuses the class by providing an
                                        explanation or soliciting explanations
                                        from students. This is also time for the
                                        instructor to ensure that everyone has
                                        understood the main point of the
                                        exercise (since it is sometimes easy to
                                        miss the point!).

                                    <p>
                                        If students are having trouble, the
                                        instructor can give hints and additional
                                        guidance to ensure students’ struggle is
                                        productive.
                                    </p>

                                Using this format, students are thinking (and
                                happily so) most of the class. Further, after
                                struggling with a question, students are
                                especially primed to hear the insights of the
                                instructor.

                                <em class="emph">core exercises</em> are geared
                                towards concepts instead of computation, though
                                some core exercises focus on simple computation.
                                They also have a geometric lean. Vectors are
                                initially introduced with familiar coordinate
                                notation, but eventually, coordinates are
                                understood to be
                                <em class="emph">representations</em> of vectors
                                rather than “true” geometric vectors, and
                                objects like the determinant are defined via
                                oriented volumes rather than formulas involving
                                matrix entries.

                                Specifically lacking are exercises focusing on
                                the mechanical skills of row reduction and
                                computing matrix inverses. Students must
                                practice these skills, but they require little
                                instructor intervention and so can be learned
                                outside of lecture (which is why core exercises
                                don’t focus on these skills).

                                understanding where students are at, (ii)
                                figuring out what to do given the current

                                        change the order of exercises at your

                                difficulty), and class observations show that
